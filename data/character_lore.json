    "lore": "Having gained fame for his alchemical talents, Albedo is a reclusive person, spending most of his time in Dragonspine. He isn't fond of most social interactions and thus rarely travels to the city of Mondstadt unless it is to meet up with his fellow alchemists or other acquaintances. Yet he's also shown to at least be fascinated or interested in them in some way, often willingly appearing in events that have some sort of social setting going on and helping out the people around him in any way he can. While he does seem to enjoy company and seeing how people interact in a social setting, he finds relationships stressful and tiresome because of the amount of effort needed to maintain them. This doesn't mean he dislikes the relationships he has with others, he simply struggles with them and can get tired out from trying to keep track of everything to keep the relationship from falling apart. He prefers being around children, especially Klee, seeing her as a younger sister. Klee in turn sees him as an older brother figure.[2]\nFueled by the feeling of enlightenment, he researches about the things that pique his interest, and once the feeling is gone, either by uncovering its truth or otherwise, he loses all interest, left with a bittersweet sensation in his mind. Along with his alchemical genius, Albedo is also a respectable artist. Having initially learned the talent as a way to help with his experiments, it is now a form of relaxation for him.[1] He is Xingqiu's illustrator and regards him as a good author.[3]\nAs much of a positive demeanor he gives off, the people of Mondstadt do not know anything about his personal life and he is particularly secretive about it towards them. To the Traveler, he does not mind sharing most of his secrets with them due to feeling a kinship of sorts as they are both not of Teyvat, him being an artificial lifeform and the Traveler a visitor from afar. He considers himself to be dangerous due to his knowledge on the Art of Khemia, something which Venti and Dainsleif are well too aware of.\nAlbedo uses the medium male model. He has bright teal eyes with three dots in each iris, pale skin, and pale blond hair reaching below his shoulders. Due to being a synthetic human, a gold diamond marking can be found on his neck.\nDespite his great achievements in the field of alchemy, he does not speak of the nature of things too hastily.\nWandering among ordinary folk oblivious to various truths of this world, he treats them with nothing but sincerity and kindness.\nPolite and graceful, he seems withdrawn on the surface, but never hesitates to lend a helping hand. No matter if you go way back, or he has just befriended you, he can always find time to draw an exquisite portrait for a friend.\nThe Chief Alchemist of the Knights of Favonius, Albedo, is a truly remarkable young man. All admire his scholarly attainments — citizens of Mondstadt and members of the Knights of Favonius alike.\n\"Genius,\" \"Kreideprinz,\" or \"Captain of the Investigation Team\"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.\nThe pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire — acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.\nAlchemy is an ancient art, and many of its secrets have been lost to history. The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.\n\"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\" Or so most alchemists would protest.\nBut as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.\nAt least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.\nThis young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Akademiya did not possess. \"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\"\nAs if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.\nSeconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.\n\"And this... is new birth.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Despite appearing as \"mean and overbearing,\" Itto is a kind soul at heart, apart from trying to pick a fight with Kujou Sara at every possible opportunity. He is not particularly intelligent, but can put in the effort when asked of him. He is respected by his gang and mostly liked by Inazuma City's people, especially children, but is at odds with the Tenryou Commission despite his mostly harmless antics and pranks.\nItto takes pride in his oni heritage and does not like those who discriminate his kind. He appreciates the sacrifice made by his blue oni brethren for ensuring that oni could be accepted into human society in the present day, even wanting to share the results with them as thanks for their efforts. He always remembers the age-old pact between the oni tribes and never uses his strength for malicious purposes, refusing to terrorize humans and steal rewards that he hadn't claimed legitimately. Due to this pride, he is extremely competitive,[2] although he knows when to concede.[3]\nItto also has a habit of making names on the go and maintaining his appearance no matter how severe the weather can be. Despite only being part-oni, Itto is extremely allergic to beans; making contact with one can cause significant shock, while consuming them can cause him to be bedridden for prolonged periods of time.[4]\nItto uses the tall male model. He has white spiked hair with pale red streaks that goes down to his back. As an oni, he has two red horns on his forehead. Itto also has eyes that fade from red to yellow and diamond-shaped pupils and has pointed ears. His face is painted with red makeup which extends from his upper eyelid to this lower eyelid, and numerous parts of his body, arms and head are also painted with red lines.\nFast as the wind and mighty as thunder, he is an intrepid man with Oni blood running through his veins.\nHis key traits would be his striking horns and piercing voice that never goes unnoticed.\nHe is an untamed soul who is wild and free, that even a person with the boldest imagination can be surprised by him.\nHis heroic spirit and ardent heart guide him wherever he goes.\nHis happiness is exuberant in each and every passing moment!\nHave you heard of the Arataki Gang before?\nNo? No problem, from today on, we are now acquainted. We are the Arataki Gang of Hanamizaka. Of course, you must be introduced to our most prominent leader: Arataki Itto!\nWhile walking through Hanamizaka, it is hard not to notice a young man of the oni race named Arataki Itto.\nNever mind his horns or piercing voice sticking out like sore thumbs — the sight of him enthusiastically joining in to play childrens' games is enough to set him apart from the crowd.\nIn any case, his obvious lack of things to do stands in stark contrast to Hanamizaka itself, where craftspeople gather in droves and busy themselves all day long.\nItto claims to be the \"first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang,\" the responsibilities and duties of which he tried to explain to some Tenryou Commission officials when they came to him to investigate a rather harmless street brawl. Unfortunately, they interrupted him not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as \"unemployed.\"\nThat designation is not exactly accurate, of course: other than the Gang's activities, which the Shogunate does not acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually working one day before taking three days off.\nAs such, a more accurate designation should have been \"three-quarters unemployed.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Many rumors swirl about Baizhu, though most of them are currently unknown — the only one the player ever hears about is that his traditional herbal medicines are extremely bitter.[2] Despite the poor taste of his medicine, most Liyue citizens have complete faith in his medical skills, such as Keqing, who considers him the right person to visit when someone cannot identify their symptoms and Xinyan,[3] who is grateful for his highly effective voice preserving medicines.[4] One of his patients, a sickly young girl named Hongdou, dislikes his medicine greatly and only agrees to visit Bubu Pharmacy because Baizhu is so kind to her, reasoning that just seeing him would make her feel better.[5] She also believes he is very clever.[6] Baizhu's reputation is so great that even the isolated adeptus Xiao is aware of him,[7] and his employee Herbalist Gui takes great care in his work to avoid sullying the good name of Dr. Baizhu and Bubu Pharmacy.[8] Despite his great medical skill, Baizhu is not regarded as \"a man of high caliber or great courage.\"[9]\nAfter meeting her by chance in the hills, Baizhu took Qiqi in, even though her memory was so poor she could barely sort herbs or remember his face.[9][10] His acceptance of Qiqi was tied to his own personal pursuits,[9] and Baizhu has grown increasingly more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life since meeting her.[11] However, it is later revealed that Baizhu sought immortality in order to protect both himself and Changsheng, aware that those who made contracts with her would eventually die young and he does not want to have others suffer the same fate as them, while not wanting her to die either.[8] He is able to make Qiqi cancel orders she has given herself by embracing her and speaking words such as \"I love you the most,\" but the effect is greatly diminished because Baizhu speaks these words very lightly.[12] At the same time, he quickly acquiesces to whatever she may request from him with no worry at all and affectionately refers to her as \"my little Qiqi.\"[13] Qiqi, who is well aware that the reason he took her in has something to do with his own pursuits, does not mind staying with him because of his concern for her.[9]\nFurthermore, he is very protective of Qiqi. Xingqiu, though interested in Qiqi's story, finds it is impossible to have a conversation with her whenever Baizhu is around.[14] Baizhu has also repeatedly intervened in Hu Tao's attempts to lay Qiqi to rest; something that Qiqi dreads and fears. Even after Hu Tao gave Qiqi an exception, she still holds a grudge towards Baizhu for his desire to live longer.[11]\nDespite the genuine efficacy of his medical practices, his business practices tend to be shady. Changsheng remarks he is pleased to have found new people to fleece after the sale of Everlasting Incense to the Traveler and Zhongli, although Baizhu does not appear to mind her warnings.[13] To Paimon, his sly attitude during their first two meetings seemed strange, yet Yanfei brushed off her concerns and claimed that Baizhu has always acted that way.[15]\nBaizhu is a tall man with light skin and long green hair, half tied up in a bun and secured with a hairstick. He has golden, snake-like eyes and is always seen wearing a pair of gold, ornate, oval-framed glasses. Before taking on Changsheng's contract, his eyes were dark pink. Baizhu is almost always seen with his pet snake, Changsheng, draped around his neck like a scarf.\nHerbalist Gui, another employee of Bubu Pharmacy, remarks that Baizhu suffers from an unknown ailment that makes him rather frail.[8] Qiqi, despite being a zombie who has to regularly exercise in order to stave off rigor mortis, is in better physical condition than he is.[16] However, it is later revealed that his contract with Changsheng was responsible for his frailness, though he is able to recover as long as he does not over-exert her powers.\n\"There's a pharmacy in Liyue called Bubu, and in it is Dr. Baizhu. His skills make all illnesses better, but his medicines are really bitter!\"\nThis nursery rhyme has been widely spread throughout Feiyun Slope, and it has been used by countless parents to warn their children not to get sick... \"or else.\"\nHowever, it seems that the main character of this nursery rhyme is hardly feared by children. Instead, it is with utmost affection that he is called \"Mr. Baizhu\" by them.\nThis impression is mostly attributable to Baizhu's gentle and friendly demeanor. Interacting with him is a most refreshing experience. And no matter how anxious the patient may be, his confident smile will never fail to reassure.\nRegrettably, Baizhu cannot save all his patients — himself, for example.\nHerbalist Gui has mentioned that Baizhu's physical condition is extremely poor, and he often has to go back to his residence to rest after seeing patients. Even so, his smile never falters while in front of people.\nWhen Gui asked him about this, he replied, \"If the doctor looks sick himself, how can his patients face their illnesses with confidence?\"\nDay after day, Baizhu heals his patients. His ever-present smile hides the numerous bitter medicines he takes and the pain he suffers alone.\nBaizhu, the owner of \"Bubu Pharmacy,\" is a master of the medicinal arts. He is benevolent and kind, yet also shrouded in mystery and other contradictions.\nDespite having countless admiring physicians begging for his attention, he has insisted on choosing a zombie who can barely sort medicinal ingredients to be his apprentice.\nAnd though only a mortal, a talking snake with powerful spiritual energy is always wrapped around his shoulders.\nMaladies major and minor may all be mitigated with his medicine, but the physician seems unable to cure himself.\nSuch a person does not go unnoticed in Liyue, for the greater a person's capabilities, the greater the calamity they could cause should their heart harbor any evil intent.\nYet both public observation and private investigation have not only found no trace of any hidden wickedness, but have seemed to confirm time and time again that his unimpeachable reputation as a benevolent doctor was, in fact, the unvarnished truth.\nAs for all those inscrutable secrets, Baizhu simply smiles and laughs:\n\"Good medicine is so bitter, so it shouldn't be a problem to let a good doctor keep a few secrets, no?\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

This makes her well-liked by many people, with children even looking up to her as an ideal role model. She treats her crew with respect, who in turn are completely loyal to her. While she does not like the Treasure Hoarders, Beidou honors a \"first come, first serve\" rule when it comes to collecting treasure[3] unless specified otherwise. Even then, the criminals fear her and try to avoid incurring her wrath, knowing that she severely outmatches them. In turn, she gives opportunities for Treasure Hoarders to leave that lifestyle behind and start over.\nThe Liyue Qixing and Liyue Harbor's administrative side, however, see Beidou in a different light. She frequently violates the laws and has no problems with paying off the hefty fines the Tianquan Ningguang lays on her as punishment.[4] While the two profess their antipathy to the other's way of life, they nevertheless remain allies when it comes to Liyue's greater good and seem to in fact have a close friendship, as they frequently play chess together.[5][6]\nBeidou uses the tall female model. She has long, waist-length dark brown hair and fair skin. Her right eye is a deep ruby-colored hue melting into gold.

This has frequently resulted in her appearing anywhere in an instant if something piques her interest, and sometimes even resulting in her running into danger in the process. Once something gets her interest, she becomes extremely relentless in an attempt to interview them.

Or alternatively, just make Charlotte disappear.\nFor this reason, the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie has on numerous occasions felt the need to distance Charlotte from the Court of Fontaine by sending her off on faraway \"field reporting\" jobs, only recalling her once the Maison Gardiennage or Special Security and Surveillance Patrol had finally managed to clear things up.\nBut despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever phased [sic] Charlotte in the slightest.\nWith her trusty companion Monsieur Verite by her side, she invariably carries out her journalistic duties with unfaltering fervor, rushing about in pursuit of all the \"truths\" out there just waiting to be discovered.\nIn the Court of Fontaine, a new \"story\" is born every minute.\nFor example, Romaritime Harbor might suddenly swell with new ships, crewed by sailors of obviously non-Fontainian origin. Some fishmonger in Poisson might suddenly buy three months' worth of fish in a single month, or countless flyers boasting of a certain place where especially delicious fish can be found might suddenly appear in the Court...\nIn the eyes of a mediocre reporter or ordinary city folk, these are \"independent\" tales, just like there will always be waves rippling across the sea's surface — such ordinary events are barely worth paying attention to at all.\nClumsier journalists might even chase these waves, and dispiritedly end up merely following the wave's patterns, constantly pumping out \"surface-level stories\" of little interest.\nBut in Charlotte's eyes, these waves are but the superficial representation of other forces. What is causing them to crest and break? That is the story she seeks.\nPerhaps it is the wild winds wailing over the surface, or perhaps they are due to the Thalatta Submarine Canyon's complex seabed topography. Of course, you can't rule out the possibility of tremors from the Elton Trench either...\nThese stories are the \"deep dives\" Charlotte desires.\nA reporter should be an agile \"seeker\" — not a mere gauche \"recorder.\"\nThis, then, is Charlotte's \"work doctrine.\"\nAs to how she avoids being swept up in her \"deep dives\"... well, that's up to Euphrasie and her fellow citizens!\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Chevreuse grew up in Fleuve Cendre.[2] She is the present Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and a frequent customer at Beaumont Workshop, often purchasing expensive materials to maintain her musket. According to Riqueti, Chevreuse has commented about the Patrol's scarce usage of Gardemeks while under her command, claiming that \"Gardemeks will only block our bullets!\"[3]\nChevreuse has a strong sense of upholding the law, mainly in part due to her childhood when her father, Donatello, served in the Gardes. Donatello intended for her to be his successor, submitting her through rigorous trials that were meant to frustrate and vex her which she completed without much issue, making him see her even more suited to uphold \"justice\" than him. Unlike the other members of Fontaine's law enforcement, Chevreuse is fairly lax, allowing members to act freely from the others. She is particularly distasteful of Gardemeks, due to them blocking their musket's shots and the potential to turn against their allies in an instant. She shares a strong bond with her subordinates, refusing to accept the idea that one of them would act outside the law without sufficient proof, and when she became Captain of the Special Patrol, some of its members began using muskets and expressing a similar dislike of Gardemeks.\nDespite upholding the law, Chevreuse does occasionally stoop to seemingly unlawful acts; she bribed Emerald for information regarding a mystery shooter[2], and turns a blind eye to Chiori throwing people out her store and driving out malignant competitors in Fontaine's fashion industry in return for intelligence.[4] Her colleagues in the Maison Gardiennage also disapprove of her method of hiring felons as \"special consultants\" for cases that she personally investigates.\nIn her spare time, Chevreuse enjoys reading, particularly books in which justice prevails over evil.[5] She also has an unhealthy obsession with junk food particularly while on work, even storing them in her uniform[2]; when off, she considers them to be her worst enemy. She also shows disdain towards uncooked food.\nChevreuse uses the medium female model. She has pale skin, violet eyes fading to pink, and long violet hair with the tips all swept upwards. Her front bangs have three strands that are white, and she wears an eyepatch over her left eye.\n\"Behave yourself or the Patrol will get you!\"\n— A warning often issued to naughty Fontainian children from exasperated parents\nOf course, those children are too young to understand how ridiculous such a thought is — that you might be dragged off by the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol for going to bed too late, eating snacks after brushing your teeth, or getting bad grades. In reality, the only people that the Patrol are really after are notorious criminals. As children grow older and come to learn this, these warnings quickly lose their effect.\n...But some members of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol can't help but resent this type of \"education\" when they notice children on the street quietly slipping away as they approach. As they see it, painting such a picture of the Patrol couldn't be more inappropriate. If people are allowed to keep saying such things, then the Patrol's infamous reputation will loom like a shadow over the children of Fontaine, and who knows how long it will stay there?\n\"What's wrong with that?\"\nThis was Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Captain Chevreuse's response as she sat there dealing with official documents.\n\"I hope they'll always remember our 'infamous reputation,' and understand the meaning behind it...\"\n\"...That way, perhaps there won't need to come a day when I have to drag them away for real.\"\nIn the Court of Fontaine, where the corpus juris is exceedingly well-developed — some might even say convoluted — there are many odd ordinances that can confound and confuse foreign tourists.\nFor example, fruit tarts may not be placed directly on unheated platters, unfinished Fonta may not be intentionally placed in the middle of roads, and one must not forget to trim the claws of pet felines...\nViolations are thus difficult to avoid. But Fontainians are quite familiar with such matters, quickly ascertaining the gravity of an offense and deciding on a course of action based on the identity of the one sent to deal with the matter.\nIf it is only a member of the establishment's staff, then perhaps a simple debate will be sufficient to resolve the issue; who doesn't enjoy a lively atmosphere? If it is a uniformed Gestionnaire, then all onlookers will have to suffer through an insufferably long-winded admonishment, and it's best to vacate the premises. If it is an officer of the Maison Gardiennage, then the parties involved won't get off scot-free, and may even have to pay fines. In this case, it's best to immediately clarify that you are an innocent bystander, and are in no way involved with the case.\nHowever, if the one to come calling is the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with her tall cap and musket slung across her back, along with a squad of Special Patrol officers...\nWell, that means a particularly vicious case is unfolding, or perhaps a hoodlum is to be violently apprehended, or some fiendish felon has kidnapped a hostage... In any case, the only thing to do in such a situation is to quickly evacuate in accordance with the instructions given by the Special Patrol and give these \"Felon Management Specialists\" room to work their magic. At the same time, keep a tight leash on your curiosity and do not attempt to conceal yourself in a nearby hidey-hole. seeking to observe their law-enforcement activities from a close distance. Even if you wish to interview them, then wait until their work is done.\nMost importantly, there's no need to feel unsafe, and even less cause for fear.\nFor as all Fontainians know, any hope criminals have to escape the long arm of the law flees whenever Captain Chevreuse is on the scene.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

The excessive yang energy also makes him particularly susceptible to heat and strong emotion, which has led to some rather unexpected results.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nChongyun has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 13 Event Wishes:\nChongyun has been included in 1 Chronicled Wish:",
    "lore": "The young exorcist from Liyue, Chongyun. One might find Chongyun as a composed and stoic individual, though his friends might not say it is true most of the time.\nChongyun is a positive individual quite literally, as he has an excess of positive energy in him. Due to this excess in positive energy, he's vulnerable to things that warm him — fiery events, food, drinks, clothing, the sun, and even blushing. In the event he is not able to suppress those feelings, he might enter a manic state of being excited, friendly or faint. In extreme cases, he may show extreme signs of irrationality. To counter said positive energy, he always wears light-colored and light-weight clothing and usually eats cold food, though even with these methods and despite his efforts, he still has issues overcoming his unusual constitution.\nDespite having a Vision, he's not as fond of it as others, believing that training is the way to become a stronger individual. Due to his intense training and the sole focus of exorcising a demon, Chongyun is extremely introverted in everything outside of exorcism.[2] He regards Xingqiu as a friend due to their similar agendas despite being pranked on by the bookworm on a frequent basis, which he usually tolerates.[3] Even beyond Xingqiu's pranks, Chongyun can be quite gullible, such as once taking the contents of a novel to be real-life events until informed otherwise.\nChongyun uses the medium male model. He has light blue hair reaching his ears, pale skin, and ice-blue cat slit eyes.\nWith Liyue as his base of operations, the exorcist Chongyun roams the land, ridding it of evil. As the heir to a clan of exorcists, he has always possessed abilities superior to most. However, this ability is not the result of training, but of an inborn trait he has come to term, \"congenital positivity.\"\nCongenital positivity is an exceedingly rare physiology that makes the body susceptible to heating up due to an overabundance of positive energy. If unchecked, those who possess such a form can easily become hot blooded. Chongyun is a particularly serious case, his shifts in mood are explosive, and he remembers nothing from such episodes. However, Chongyun's condition is also his greatest asset, for all he needs to do to expel evil spirits is to sit awhile in whatever dark corner they may haunt.\nAs such, Chongyun's path as an exorcist has been smooth as smooth can be. However, he himself does not approve of this manner of doing things. In his honest and upright heart, leaning on his unique physiology to exorcise evil is but a cheap trick. An exorcist must, in his estimation, perform their duties with an exorcist's arts.\nTo counteract this congenital positivity, Chongyun has several disciplines that he practices. He does not go out in the sun or wear thick clothes, and he abstains from hot beverages and hot and spicy food. He takes up no quarrels, and he indulges no tempers. Yet despite searching high and low, and far and wide, he has been unable to find a lasting solution to his condition.\nThis troubled the young exorcist. The evil spirits were expelled, yes, but if things kept going like this, how would he ever prove himself to be a qualified exorcist?\nAs he sits atop an ice-capped mountain chewing on a snow bun, Chongyun cannot help but sigh. The road ahead is still long indeed.\nThroughout its long history, Liyue has never had a lack of rumors and myths regarding all manner of evil spirits and demons. And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.\nChongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits.\nHowever, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.\nChongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.\nTherefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.\nYet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Originally an Eleazar-afflicted victim of Fatui human experimentation, Collei wandered the world as a vagrant until she met Amber in Mondstadt. Since then, Collei has turned her life around, and currently serves as a trainee Forest Ranger in the Avidya Forest.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nCollei has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 8 Event Wishes:\nCollei has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "Collei was born sickly, so her worried parents brought her to a seer and begged him to save her. He explained the illness as being \"touched by the deev\" — supernatural creatures with negative properties — and claimed that had to give their daughter to him in order to save her. However, he was working with the Fatui Harbinger Il Dottore and instead of saving her, turned Collei into a test subject for their Archon Residue experiments.\nWhether the Fatui had let Collei go or if she had escaped herself is unknown, but she eventually found herself wandering alone. On account of her sickliness, she was treated poorly wherever she went; she was often abused by passing pedestrians, had stones thrown at, and pushed around. This fueled her hatred for people and gods, and a strong desire for vengeance.\nThe disease Collei is afflicted with is called Eleazar. Unique to Sumeru, this is a disorder that causes dark and hardened scales to form on the body. First symptoms are mild numbness on the affected areas of the skin, but as the disease progresses symptoms of general fatigue and peripheral paresthesia (abnormal sensation of the skin on the limbs) may occur. The final stage of this disease causes complete paralysis of the afflicted person, rendering them completely immobile. These symptoms hint that Eleazar might be a neurological disease. This condition is what causes Collei to be perceived as \"clumsy\" by other people, as it affects her ability to hold or carry objects, often dropping them to the ground. According to Tighnari, there is no cure for Eleazar, only preventive care may be provided to stop the disease from advancing to a more serious stage. In the days Collei spent with the Fatui, Dottore was able to keep the disease controlled by unknown methods.\nUpon the removal of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's consciousness from Irminsul, Collei and the other Eleazar patients have recovered.\nWhen Collei first arrives in Mondstadt, she is extremely wary and suspicious of people because of her past experiences, preferring to be left alone and making her seem cold. Her pessimistic view of the world comes from the mistreatment and abuse she endured everywhere. She also has a rather low opinion of herself, pushing people away because she is \"unclean\" and says she is unworthy of their time.\nShe was initially annoyed by Amber because of her cheerful and optimistic personality, but Amber shows her kindness by offering to help her find that something she lost, even insisting they are friends and protecting her from Kaeya's intimidation multiple times. The two continue to grow closer during the course of the manga and Collei begins to trust Amber, becoming less wary of people as her view of the world becomes brighter.\nWhen Amber protected Collei from Barnabas, Collei was touched by Amber's resolve and realizes that she too wishes to be able to protect others.[2] After having her powers sealed by Cyno, she decides to leave with him to Sumeru in hopes of learning more about the world.\nBy the time she meets the Traveler, Collei is shown to have matured whilst training under Tighnari and is now considerably more positive. She expresses great admiration for Amber, whose compassion deeply moved Collei to the degree that it influenced her behavior and hobbies. Inspired by Amber's benevolence, Collei tries to be very helpful and proactive in her Forest Ranger duties and strives to be as friendly as possible to everyone. Although she still has struggles with her literacy and Eleazar, she attempts to discard her past pessimism in favor of pushing forward and doing the best she can regardless.\nShe also developed a deep sense of empathy, extending even to the gods, whom she used to deem forsaken by, she now wonders if they too can feel just as helpless. She states that looking back, her extended hatred towards the world outside the Fatui was \"childish.\" She also expresses guilt over her time in Mondstadt and is interested in apologizing.[3]\nDespite her improved outlook, it is clear that Collei has yet to fully put her trauma behind her. Whilst no longer being bitter about it, Collei still finds it very difficult to open up to others about her past and avoids the subject when possible, as it brings back painful memories. Her introverted nature also leads her to occasionally spend time alone in a tree hollow, where she writes about any troubles or frustrations she may feel.[4]\nCollei is somewhat of a bad liar, only being able to convince Amber on why she wanted to know about the Fatui's research. She is also prone to panic attacks and breakdowns, and especially hates being pushed or shoved around. Even just trying to touch her might cause extreme fear and discomfort, as shown when Paimon tried to playfully touch her the day they met for the first time in Sumeru. This shock apparently triggered a flare-up of her disease, causing her to be bedridden the next day.\nCollei uses the medium female model. She has short, wavy light green hair that reaches her shoulders and purple, almost magenta eyes.\nCollei's hair in the manga was chin-length.\nWhen she first appeared, much of her body and face were covered in bandages. She wore baggy trousers, one that resembles a sirwal, and a tapper hat made from bandages. Tied around her hips is a green-orange cloth. Later, Amber loaned one of her old outfits to Collei to attend Ludi Harpastum in. Collei also wore a beige satchel, in which she store the collected Fatui devices.\nIn Chapter 16, she appeared with a plain black shirt and a simple pair of shorts under a hooded cloak. She also wore an ushanka hat, a pair of gloves, and boots that reach up to below her knees. Lastly, she uses the same green-orange cloth and beige satchel from earlier.\nA trainee ranger active in Avidya Forest. Positive and optimistic, enthusiastic and kind.\nCollei is from Sumeru, but few people know about her experiences before she came to Gandharva Ville, and she herself never mentions anything about her past.\nPerhaps because of Collei's pure gaze and earnest attitude, people saw her reserved demeanor as just part of her personality and did not shy away from her because of it.\nThe children of Gandharva Ville love to watch her sew dolls, and those who find themselves lost in Avidya Forest are willing to follow her back to safety.\nSince her return to Sumeru, Collei has earned the trust and respect of the people with her actions.\nBut at night, when everything is dark, she sometimes thinks about those memories that she has buried away.\nEven though everything is going well, she still hopes that she can work even harder and improve faster in the future.\n—Only in this way can she overcome her past weak self as quickly as possible.\n\"Helpful,\" \"bright and sunny,\" \"friendly and passionate\"... Just ask around Gandharva Ville, and you'll hear this Trainee Forest Ranger praised to the skies in such terms.\nAs long as her body allows, no matter how busy school gets, Collei will never slack off when it comes to her forest patrol work, and is always willing to lend a warm helping hand to whoever is in trouble, regardless of what walk of life they are from.\nNevertheless, even as enthusiastic and positive as she is, there seems to be a past and things on her mind that she is not yet ready to reveal to others.\nIf in the woods where she often patrols, you should chance upon a tree hollow full of strange notes, or hear someone whispering nearby...\nNo matter what you witnessed or overheard, please kindly take a detour and consider it a silly prank — one played by an Aranara, perhaps.\nAfter all, there are some things that only a tree hollow can know — for now, anyway.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

In spite of this, Cyno has a fun side outside of his role in the Akademiya, as he has an affinity for Genius Invokation TCG and constantly cracks unfunny jokes.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nCyno has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 3 Event Wishes:\nCyno has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "Cyno is a curt, stoic and generally emotionless young man with a ruthlessness and vicious approach to his duty as a matra that make him intimidating and unapproachable. He cares little for niceties or social gatherings and is known throughout Sumeru for his ruthless efficiency at upholding the law.\nDespite his young age, Cyno holds the position of General Mahamatra in the Akademiya and takes his position seriously. Cyno is extremely dedicated to upholding the Akademiya's rules and punishing any transgressions, to such an extent that even the sages of the Akademiya (ostensibly his superiors) are wary of him. Notoriously, Cyno will relentlessly pursue any individuals that try to flee his judgment, even across the desert — a trait that, in combination with his prowess as a hunter and warrior, makes escaping from Cyno nigh impossible. Due to this, Cyno's name is infamous within Sumeru and many scholars fear the prospect of ever meeting him, despite the fact that he only handles cases of significant interest.\nNotably, Cyno idolizes \"justice\" above all; though this predominantly manifests in his pursuit of suspected criminals, Cyno will also protect criminals from any danger that arises during their escape attempts until they can, in his view, be properly judged by the Akademiya. Although he is often viewed by the Akademiya's scholars as an obstacle or a threat to their research (complaints to which Cyno is indifferent), Cyno views his role as that of a protector, preventing seekers of knowledge from being led astray and becoming dangers to both themselves and the world. However his being blessed with an Electro Vision suggests that his view of justice is closer to a desire to preserve the law, which he holds as eternal, rather than being interested in justice in and of itself.\nDespite his seriousness in academics and work-related matters, Cyno is fairly relaxed outside of Akademiya duties, being an avid fan of Genius Invokation TCG. He shows concern for Collei, frequently visiting her when he has the time to ensure that she's doing well, as well as harboring friendships with Tighnari, Alhaitham and Kaveh. Despite his intentions to put people at ease, he maintains his emotionless, harsh attitude in most situations, even outside of work. Aware that his reputation as General Mahamatra often intimidates those around him (even his fellow Matras), Cyno tells jokes as a way to help people relax around him, though his jokes are generally unfunny and his long-winded attempts to explain them even more so.\nCyno also confesses to a fondness for the desert from which he hails, finding himself most at ease there and often taking nighttime strolls there to help himself relax.\nCyno uses the medium male model. He has tan skin, red-orange eyes, and medium-length gray hair.\nCyno is depicted wearing a large, black cape including a hood with what looks like jackal ears sewn on it. His cape seems to take inspiration from Northern Africa, showing some similarities with the large capes worn in the Sahara in order to avoid the heat, and to stay protected during sandstorms.\nIf an Akademiya researcher is required to have a formal meeting with the General Mahamatra, Cyno, it usually does not bode well.\nIn general, a personal visit from Cyno implies that these researchers are perpetrators of serious academic offences: plagiarism, bribery, academic fraud, false declarations, misappropriation of funds, malicious competition, appropriation of someone else's dissertations, and more... The only thing left for these researchers to do is to follow the General Mahamatra and face disciplinary action.\nBut these researchers will not accept their sentence so easily.\nMost of them try to bribe the General Mahamatra with Mora. These \"wealthy people\" will then be punished even more severely. Meanwhile, some choose to use force in an irrational act of recalcitrance... After paying the price for their defiance, they are subjected to a harsher sentence.\nOthers, at their wits' end, even feign madness, claiming memory loss or pleading insanity in a desperate attempt to escape punishment.\nHowever, General Mahamatra Cyno has unfailing patience when dealing with these people. In his own words:\n\"As a Matra, it is one of my duties to help people 'remember' the mistakes they have made.\"\nAs the leader of all Matra, General Mahamatra Cyno is well known to everyone in the Akademiya.\nHis duties are to arrest those who violate the Akademiya's rules and regulations, terminate illegal studies, and uphold discipline of the Akademiya. Nevertheless, researchers feel that this General Mahamatra does nothing but undermine academic progress and prohibit scientific research. Some even claim that he is \"cutting off the path to knowledge\" and can be seen as a dire threat to any researcher eager to seek knowledge...\nOver time, researchers have come to shrink away from Cyno in silence whenever they so much as see him, wanting to have nothing to do with him.\nBut the General Mahamatra is hardly bothered by such things.\nIf this exaggerated public image can really deter some researchers, that will in no way be an inconvenience for his work.\nPlus, in the words of that Forest Watcher friend of his,\n\"The research conducted by most researchers is nowhere significant enough to result in a talk with a Matra.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "As with all Eremites, Dehya enjoys training and sparring whenever she gets the chance. She gets along well with Dunyarzad and respects her determination, wanting to help her in any way possible, albeit slightly embarrassed to publicly admit it; when Dunyarzad tried to revive the Sabzeruz Festival, Dehya secretly sold her claymore and anonymously donated the Mora to help out. While not a follower of the gods, Dehya does respect Lesser Lord Kusanali, due to seeing how much of an impact she made in Dunyarzad's life.\nDehya uses the tall female model. She has lightly tanned skin, sky-blue eyes with yellow 'cat-eye' pupils, and dusky blonde-accented dark brown hair.\n\"The Eremites,\" a loosely-organized mercenary organization, is Sumeru's most powerful armed force. They consist of many mercenaries and bands of warriors-for-hire who carry out assignments independently.\nOne such brigade is the \"Blazing Beasts,\" whose most renowned member is Dehya, also known as the \"Flame-Mane.\"\nA highly regarded warrior among the mercenary circles, Dehya is brave without being impulsive, and strong without being arrogant. Life in the harsh desert environment has allowed Dehya to accumulate much combat wisdom through various battles, and she is by no means your typical insolent and ignorant martial artist.\nAs long as the pay is good and the commission reasonable, Dehya is more than willing to take up her sword to defend those who hire her.\nHowever, there is one thing these employers should be aware of. That is, the agreement they establish with Dehya is only temporary and purely transactional. The reins to tame this lioness is never, and will never be in their hands.\nAlthough mercenaries sell their strength to make a living, their dignity and lives belong only to themselves.\nThe desert lioness is no one's slave, and her sword only follows her heart.\nThe term \"Eremites\" does not reference a specific group or organization, but all those who are born of the desert and ply a trade using their martial prowess, operating as mercenaries.\nFrail is humanity in such a desolate profession. To survive, those who walk the path of a mercenary will naturally come together, forming loose bands of mercenaries.\nThough the Eremites are many, few among them will be remembered as legends, with most bound to be as evanescent as sand in the wind. Yet there are exceptions who, like Dehya, may linger in the annals of history.\nThe \"Flame-Mane\" Dehya is fierce and brave, the lion her moniker invokes an analogy for her might. The nickname itself, meanwhile, denotes her passionate nature.\nShould you be planning to hire a mercenary to serve as a bodyguard, Dehya stands as a prime choice. Procuring her service runs an expensive premium, but her abilities make that a worthy expenditure indeed.\nCompared to those overconfident fools hawking their talents as hired blades on the street and novices capable of little more than brute force, Dehya is a conscientious professional.\nWith all this said, those who wish to procure her services should make haste, for there is a long line of other potential clients that have need of the Flame-Mane, and the opportunity, just as grains in the desert, will slip away before long.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

He decided to take matters into his own hands by becoming, to his dismay and hidden heartache, the “Darknight Hero” to protect Mondstadt's people. Someone must face the darkness before dawn so others can dream.\nDiluc was once an idealistic young man, dedicated to his work with the Knights of Favonius. After his father's untimely demise as a result of using a Delusion, along with Inspector Eroch ordering Diluc to cover up the incident, his faith in the Knights shattered and he left the organization. Even after Eroch was purged from the Knights for being a traitor, he still holds resentment towards them. He claims that the Knights take too long to get the job done, although he still appreciates those who put the effort in, such as Lisa and Jean.\nWhen he was a member of the Knights, he adored his father, Crepus. Being praised by his father made him happier than anything else, and Crepus told Diluc to be faithful in his duties. In his childhood, Diluc had a lighthearted and happy nature. After his father's death, though his speech comes across as bitter and grumpy, he has a gentle, tender, and modest nature. He tends to part with possessions he no longer needs, such as his father's private residence, but struggles more with letting go of memories and emotional wounds.[2]\nDiluc is not fond of alcohol, disliking its taste and that it clouds his mind when working. He prefers non-alcoholic drinks such as grape juice and apple cider, which he had ordered developed upon his return to Mondstadt. This appears to be little known, likely because he is the current owner of Mondstadt's largest winery. He expresses surprise upon learning that Diona also loathes alcohol, having initially believed he was the only bartender in Mondstadt that did not like alcohol.[3]\nDiluc uses the tall male model. He has pale skin, red eyes, and bright red hair that goes down to the middle of his back.\n▌Master of the Dawn Winery · Diluc\nI will keep marching on until dawn.\n========================================\nPeople in Mondstadt like to have a glass of dandelion wine after a long day.

This means he has a huge stream of revenue and an entire network of information, in the form of tavern patrons' gossip, right at his fingertips.\nIn a way, he is the uncrowned king of Mondstadt.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

While Diona adores her father and idolized him in her youth, witnessing his change in personality while drunk shattered the pedestal she put him on — and started her vendetta against alcohol. She despises just about anyone who indulges in alcohol, apart from Lisa[2] and Eula.[3]\nAlthough Diona has the option of literally destroying the industry,[4] she chose not to, instead opting to do so by plummeting the industry's reputation by becoming a bartender and serving terrible drinks. Unfortunately for her, her long-forgotten childhood friend, the Spring Fairy, blessed her with a magic touch that makes all of her drinks delicious, regardless of how noxious the ingredients used are, and she herself is unaware of this.\nIn her interactions, Diona proves to be a classic tsundere and is very naïve. She worries over the Traveler's ability to get home safely without night vision and offers to escort them home until they remind her that street lamps exist, after which she quickly denies ever having offered escorting them. She blames Diluc for her father's problems, even though the Dawn Winery had existed well before him or his father,[5] and fails to see why the fans she and Barbara gets are drastically different.[6] She also appears to have attachment issues and craves companionship, implied to be a result of Draff neglecting her when he's in his drunken stupors. She genuinely enjoys the company of those who have earned her trust, such as Klee and the Traveler, finding comfort in the Traveler's touch even begs them not to leave her and \"become another dream\". Although she displays many cat-like mannerisms, such as her love for fish, naps, hatred of vegetables and water, and tendency to meow, purr, and bite when angry, she hates being referred to as a cat in this regard. Also true to her feline nature, she is implied to be astraphobic,[7] as well as aquaphobic.\nDiona uses the short female model. She has fair skin, short pink hair, teal green eyes, and round eyebrows. Diona's cat ears and tail appear to be those of a calico cat.\nThe incredibly popular bartender of the Cat's Tail tavern, rising star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses...\nSuch is Diona's image in the eyes of her clientele.\nYet this feisty feline young lady from Springvale prefers to see herself as the \"Wine Industry Slayer.\"\nThat ambition is reflected in her bartending philosophy: \"I'm gonna ruin the taste of alcohol for everyone, for good!\"\nThis subtle contradiction comes from a blessing — or, in Diona's mind, probably more of a curse — that has been placed upon her:\nFor any drink mixed by her hand is destined to taste delicious beyond belief.\nNevertheless, to this day, her deep distaste for alcohol prevents her from giving up her mission.\nDevoted to concocting the most disgusting drink in the world that will single-handedly destroy Mondstadt's wine industry, Diona has been concentrating all of her efforts on this pursuit.\nWhenever a guest walks into the Cat's Tail, they will immediately glance in the direction of the bar.\nBehind it often stands a girl with mildly-twitching cat ears, cocktail shaker in hand, and an unhappy look on her face.\nThis is the mixologist Diona, ascendant star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses.\nHowever, she does not make these wonderful cocktails on purpose — indeed, quite the opposite.\nHer mixing methods can seem a little \"inscrutable\" to an outsider. To herself, Diona tries nothing less than her hardest to ruin that hateful grog.\nBut no matter the drink, it will turn out to be an unimaginably sumptuous brew so long as it passes through her hands.\nThis is a \"blessing\" she has received, though that blessing is a huge headache for her.\nFor this mixologist proclaims herself to be the \"Wine Industry Slayer,\" and her final objective is the utter destruction of Mondstadt's entire wine industry.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

She is extremely wealthy and highly obsessed with Mora, seeing everyone and everything as a way to make profit. Her obsession with Mora is due to the fact that her older sister had an illness which her family couldn't afford treatment for at the time. She uses her spontaneous appearance and words to sway customers into buying her goods despite her jaw-dropping prices.\nWilling to make Mora off just about anything, Dori also partakes in the black market, which has also caught the Matras' attention. Due to this, she implemented some protocols to vet all potential customers to prevent her, her employees and potential customers from being held liable.\nDori uses the short female model. She has fair skin, golden brown eyes, and short pink hair. She also wears a pair of small glasses with reddish lenses and gold diamond-shaped frames.\nThe unpredictable and elusive Dori seems to have an uncountable number of treasures.\nAs the most \"resourceful\" merchant in Sumeru, she has a way to get you anything you need, be it precious gems, rare herbs, and exotic items that no one has ever heard of.\nOf course, this doesn't come at a small price. Dori always has a warm smile on her face when quoting you jaw-dropping prices.\nSome people see her as rain after a long drought, one that brings timely relief, while others regard her as an unscrupulous merchant who takes advantage of the situation.\nBut all this chatter doesn't faze Dori in the slightest. The only thing that echoes in the Palace of Alcazarzaray has always been the crisp sound of Mora tinkling.\n\"Dori Sangemah Bay, owner of the Palace of Alcazarzaray, super-duper merchant who sells everything you need!\"\nWhen one holds Dori's name card, this impressive title instantly comes into view.\nDori is, however, indeed the most special Sumeru merchant of all.\nShe already possesses vast wealth, but is still fervently passionate about earning Mora;\nShe already owns multiple well-renowned merchant caravans, yet she always travels across Sumeru to sell her marvelous items in person.\nSpeaking of which, her wares are just as curious as her style: special travel kit, outdoor dryer machines, automatic snowball launchers... You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Eula is a descendant of Mondstadt's old aristocracy, being from the now-overthrown Lawrence Clan infamous for their tyrannical rule over Mondstadt. She dislikes people who view her similarly to the rest of her clan due to this mistrust, which has not been forgotten. She has a habit of declaring and getting \"vengeance\" against her enemies to redeem her family name. She is one of the few Lawrence Clan nobles who realize that their actions against the people of Mondstadt were unjustified and does not care about her family's past. As a young child, she was forced by her family to learn noble etiquette as part of an educational regime so harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.\nAlthough Eula considers most of her clan's customs despicable, she personally enjoys the traditional \"Dance of Sacrifice\" and incorporates it into her style of \"Favonius Bladework.\"[2] She has a strained relationship with her family, who denounce her as a traitor for leaving the clan.[3] She has stated that she would not hesitate to destroy her own family if they endangered Mondstadt, even finding it fitting,[4] though she does care for them, mostly by ensuring that any of their plans to restore the family name weren't excessive. While she still tends to act like a clan noble on the outside, inside she is actually a kind-hearted person, echoed by both Amber and Sara. She is good friends with Yanfei after saving her from the Abyss Order, who compares her similarly in the way that they're both not bound by convention and solve problems their own way.[5] More recently, she also has befriended Captain Beidou when they met at Dornman Port, to the pleasant surprise of the Traveler and Paimon.[6]\nDespite her family's infamous history, her acquaintances consider her a reliable ally and friend[7] with a unique sense of humor,[8] and they have grown to understand that her controversial statements are but a product of her personality.[7] The Knights under her command also support her unconditionally. Whenever someone points out something to her that she doesn't want to admit, she either raises her chin or puts her hands on her hips.\nEula uses the tall female model. She has a pale complexion and eyes that appear to exhibit sectoral heterochromia, fading from dark purple to pale yellow. She has choppy, unevenly cut light blue hair.\nAs the Captain of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company and the renowned Spindrift Knight, Eula spends most of her time out in the wild and has won much acclaim leading her team of scouts on patrol. The knights stationed in the mountains and valleys are often the target of sneak attacks from monsters, but Eula has always been able to resolve these crises by rendering swift support. She has also led proactive attacks to destroy Abyss Order strongholds time and again, nipping their nefarious plots in the bud.\nDue to Eula's background, many contradictions surround her — she is a descendant of the Lawrence clan and is considered by the citizens of Mondstadt to be the embodiment of the blood of sinners. Despite everything, she severed ties with her clan many years ago and joined the Knights of Favonius. Yet prejudice is not so easily dispelled, and Eula has not been treated fairly. In the eyes of Mondstadt's citizens, she remains an \"outsider,\" or even a \"dangerous individual.\"\nYears of such experiences have led Eula to build an invisible shield to protect herself from unwarranted harm. The term \"vengeance\" is perhaps the most visible edge of this shield. Only by disregarding wild gossip and trying to accept the logic of her approach to the world can one come to understand the truth behind the complex shell of this young woman.\nEula's role within the Knights of Favonius is Captain of the Reconnaisance Company.\nThe nature of her work means that she rarely sets foot in the city — she spends most of her time out in the wild, leading her team of scouts as they hunt down Abyss Order operatives and other monsters.\nKnown as the Spindrift Knight, Eula wields her blade with consummate skill, but perhaps more importantly, she is well-versed in strategy and possesses great courage and excellent intuition. Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.\nOn the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and Eula.\nFor Eula is a descendant of the once-aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.\nConsequently, Eula has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.\nSo, whenever Eula appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.\nHowever, Eula is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.\nWhen people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for \"vengeance.\" This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.\nOne person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of Eula.\n\"The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Despite being a Haravatat scholar, Faruzan specializes more in the Kshahrewar studies, being highly knowledgeable in machine mechanics and language. She's highly respected in the Kshahrewar school for her contributions, but she still remains a Haravatat scholar and refuses any attempts to join Kshahrewar. Due to technically living longer than others in part due to the King Deshret ruins she had been trapped in, she self-identifies as a senior despite her youthful appearance and demands respect from them. While proud and a bit stubborn, Faruzan does secretly struggle with coming to terms with her circumstances since her old friends and family had passed on in her absence as many believed her to be dead.\nDue to the circumstances involved in her entombment, many people tend to see her thesis and points being outdated. As a result of her supposedly \"outdated\" research, Faruzan has issues acquiring Mora, which frequently baffles and irritates her. She becomes extremely delighted when offered a large amount of payment.\nFaruzan uses the medium female model. She has fair skin, and her hair is a turquoise gradient, from pale turquoise at the roots to a darker turquoise at the ends. She has messy bangs that frame the sides of her face, and her hair is cut short except for two locks of hair that mimic twin tails. Her eyes are a pale shade of blue and are partially golden, and her pupils are interestingly heterochromic and triangle-shaped; her right eye is a pale shade of Aquamarine and her left eye is a dark shade of Indigo.\nThere is a legend circulating among the Kshahrewar students:\nIf you have failed your mechanics exams and do not dare ask for remedial lessons from your displeased tutor, you can make your way to Haravatat next door and ask Madam Faruzan for some tips.\nThere is no need to prepare a gift. Just remember to show sincerity and humility, and call her \"Madam\" respectfully. That will be sufficient to get into the living encyclopedia of mechanics' good graces.\nMadam Faruzan's explanations are simple to understand yet insightful, and her in-depth knowledge really makes people wonder if she had a hand in writing the syllabus. Her guidance will help resolve the most daunting problems, though there remain two problems that all students must overcome on their own:\nThe first is how to hide their surprise when they see her youthful appearance.\nThe second is to refrain from asking her why she has been shunned in Haravatat despite having such erudition, and whether she should consider joining Kshahrewar.\nIf you are unfortunate enough to commit one of these faux pas, you shall bear witness to rhetoric worthy of a household name in Haravatat, especially when in the field of criticizing and reprimanding others.\nIf you were to open any Kshahrewar textbook, you will find Faruzan's record penned proudly upon the author page.\n\"Faruzan, outstanding researcher of the Akademiya, winner of the Sumeru Puzzlers' League Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the seminal scholars of Ancient Mechanics.\"\nBut if you were to talk to Haravatat students about their choices, they frown as they speak of Faruzan's current state.\n\"Oh, you mean her... Well, her research is... obsolete, and there's no way it'll pass review, so you might as well find another mentor.\"\nSuch reviews, as disparate as heaven and earth, arouse one's curiosity as a matter of course.\nAnd when asked by her juniors, Madam Faruzan often wears an inscrutable look.\n\"Hmm? You mean to ask what happened these past hundred years? And how things came to this pass? Ah, but this is a secret most great. Come closer, and I shall tell you. Yes, yes, closer...\"\n—And then she gives them a good conk on the head.\n\"First! That curiosity of yours is best served in your studies. And secondly!

    "lore": "Due to her upbringing as a child, Fischl is obsessed with fantasy stories and roleplays as a benevolent princess. She speaks in a polite and formal manner to all, which greatly confuses those who interact with her. For this purpose, Oz ends up translating most of her speech if they are confused. She is so used to speaking this way that breaking character ends up confusing the people she talks to just as much as staying in character. Fischl has a knack for investigating in part due to her own theories and Oz, which has allowed her to quickly climb up the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild. Even when her ideas sound outlandish, such as claiming a meteor shower to be the result of a curse, Oz is quick to ask others not to underestimate her intuition, as her instincts are very keen.\nOutside of guild duties, many people view her strangely due to her her antics and roleplay, while this sometimes bothers her, she continues roleplaying regardless because it's her passion. She has very few friends and appreciates those who are willing to go along with her despite her eccentricities.\nOutside of roleplaying, she is a kind and well-behaved yet bashful girl. She gets along well with her parents, even if she doesn't spend much time with them or they disagree with some of her decisions. Lisa, who generally gets in a bad mood when people neglect the books they borrow from the library, states that Fischl always keeps the books she borrows in good condition and returns them early. She cares about her friends and peers, even if not particularly close, showing concern about the well-being of her \"retinue\" (Fellow Adventurers' Guild members). When she unintentionally breaks character or reveals something about herself, she often gets flustered. She tends not to dwell too much on the past, trying to see herself as Fischl, not as her true identity, who she considers a different person, as thinking of her past brings her sadness. Deep down, she can also be quite self-deprecating and insecure, having a hard time taking setbacks well, this can cause her to cling to the escapism and comfort of her persona.\nFischl uses the medium female model. She has fair skin and blonde hair that extends to the middle of her back. Her visible eye is light green.

    "lore": "Compared to his adoptive siblings, Lyney and Lynette, Freminet is introverted, finding it very hard to speak with people he deems talkative, such as Estelle.[2] Freminet enjoys diving, finding the ocean a way to get away from the stress and express his feelings. During his early years, Freminet learned to suppress his emotions in order to carry out his orders with ease. As he became more accustomed to this way of dealing with his thoughts, he began to stagnate his own emotional development, often wishing to become akin to a machine but never achieving it.[3] Freminet has poor self-esteem, as he frequently believes himself to be useless outside of anything other than diving and tinkering with clockwork machines. He is also notably bad at lying.[4]\nFreminet has become increasingly distant from his siblings. Despite this, he shows immense care and respect for them, often expressing guilt. He does not take well to criticism and shaming, usually becoming visibly distraught.[4][5] Freminet is attached to his mechanical penguin, Pers, which he hopes to modify so that it can fly one day.[6] He also has an attachment to his diving helmet, which he kept even after acquiring his Vision as it allows him to block off outside noise and makes him feel safe. To Freminet, the helmet makes him feel as though he's looking through a lens into a fantasy world, which he claims are worlds that exist somewhere, just not here.[7]\nFreminet uses the medium male model. He has periwinkle eyes, dark eyelashes, pale, freckled skin, and pale, blond hair. His hair is choppy and neck length. Part of his bangs cover his left eye.\nAs the realm of Hydro, Fontaine's underwater vistas are positively breathtaking. But not everyone gets to enjoy this mysterious world beneath the waves. Even for those who have mastered the basics, diving can be full of peril to say the least. Among the ranks of able divers, Freminet is renowned for his outstanding professionalism, exceptional ability to stay focused, as well as his abundant maritime knowledge. It's just a shame that, as a classic lone wolf, he never accepts commissions from others.\nAs the younger brother of Fontaine's famous magical duo Lyney and Lynette, Freminet prefers to stay out of the limelight. Other people's gazes, responses, and comments make him uncomfortable and interrupt the rhythm of his breathing. He prefers instead to slip away and bask in the weightlessness of the ocean, pouring his heart out to a Romaritime Flower.\nHe looks indifferent, but in fact it's just that his passion never comes back up for air.\nIn his early years, Freminet always preferred to be alone. His unassuming appearance would make people drop their guard, which was something that the House of the Hearth used to their advantage, sending him in behind enemy lines to complete the missions they had assigned him swiftly and without mercy.\n\"All I have to do is put on my helmet, shut out the background noise, and carry out my orders.\" Freminet began to see himself as an unfeeling clockwork toy.\nIt was only later that the House of the Hearth changed into something else entirely. Under \"Father's\" orders, Freminet joined up with Lyney and Lynette to form their team of three at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete. At first, Freminet often felt at a complete loss.\nIt was almost as if they could read each other's minds, such was the tacit understanding between the pair of siblings. He felt like a spare part in comparison, worthy only of lying around in some dark corner, accumulating dust.\n\"Freminet, pay attention! What does this look like to you?\"\n\"A... card with a picture of Pers on it?\"\n\"Hehe, are you sure? It's Pers alright... Here you go, take him! Alright, your task this time is very tricky. I've prepared an especially crucial role for you and this little 'hero'! The plan is as follows...\"\nFreminet very rarely feels anything when he's carrying out his missions. But when they were celebrating their success, a smile crept onto his face after his first taste of one of the Hotel Debord's delicious desserts.\n\"Here, have mine too.\" said Lynette as she filled his cup with tea. \"We're family.\"\nWhether you're a tourist visiting Fontaine for the first time or an adventurer who's set their heart on finding legendary treasures, you're sure to be captivated by the enchantments of the underwater world. But those who attempt to explore the depths without first undergoing rigorous training or making the necessary preparations are gambling with their lives. Treacherous underwater currents, unexpected bodily reactions, and monsters lurking in the deep... Peril always comes without knocking. Seeking the help of a professional diver is always a wise choice.\nIf you ask people who's the most talented diver around, you're likely to hear the name of Freminet. Even old veterans, bronzed and toughened by long exposure to the elements, never tire of lauding his skills. They speak not only of his familiarity with Fontaine's complex hydrological systems, but also of his prowess in coping with different underwater environments and seasonal conditions, as well as his expert control over his breathing. He seems to swim wherever he pleases — even through caverns deep down on the ocean floor, where no one else dares to venture...\nWhen many people hear this, they suddenly think of something or other that Freminet could do for them. But no matter how great the promised rewards, the veterans always respond the same way – with a shake of the head and a regretful sigh.\n\"The boy wouldn't hear of it... He's a nice lad, just a bit too shy.\"\nThe conversation usually stops here.\nAs Freminet sees it, other people's compliments are as capricious as the weather. He finds it hard to fathom their true intentions, and is constantly worried that he'll put his foot in it by saying something wrong.\nPerhaps his true friends are the Tidalga and Romaritime Flowers that he spends so much time with. They hold a much dearer place in his heart than do reputation and reward, which float around on the surface. When he dives, he stays silent for long periods of time in the company of his old friends, and lets the silence swallow up his fears and anxieties. In so doing, he lets out all the things weighing on his mind, all the things that he can't say to anyone else.\nThe reason he chose to dive was that simple — to find some peace and quiet, and escape everything happening in the world above.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Ganyu is usually very meek, mild-mannered, and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage, and is easily flustered. She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.[2][3] Privately, she tends to snap whenever people speak ill of Beidou[4] or the Geo Archon. She greatly respects her fellow adepti, especially Xiao and Cloud Retainer, seeing them as a mentor and a maternal figure respectively, although she becomes extremely anxious in the latter's presence due to her tendency to unintentionally ramble.\nGanyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.[5]\nShe has a huge work schedule, often working overtime and is prone to falling asleep. As a result, Ganyu has very few friends outside of work. Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is very sensitive about her horns, weight and childhood, becoming visibly flustered when any of these three are mentioned in front of her.\nGanyu uses the medium female model. She has fair skin and cerulean blue hair that naturally bunches in the middle and fades into a darker shade at the ends. She has black-red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. She has eyes that appear to exhibit sectoral heterochromia, fading from purple at the top to pinkish-gold at the bottom.\nFor the Liyue Qixing of the lofty Yujing Terrace, Ganyu is not merely a companion to serve them, but is instead coordinator of the web of information that moves across Liyue Harbor, and the architect of administrative efficiency.\nComplex meeting minutes, disorderly report data... Every day piles of documents flow by like water, each one personally compiled by her into clear and concise words in order to assist the Qixing's every decision and negotiation as they flow through various organizational departments.\nIn the eons that have gone by, the Qixing have changed with each succession of their posts, while only Ganyu has lived to see the flourishing of Liyue Harbor from beginning to the modern day.\nThe human blood that runs through her veins makes her reluctant to leave the splendor of the city lights, while her adeptus side leads her to yearn for the gentle serenity of her adeptal homeland.\nFor the half-human, half-adeptus Ganyu, between the bustling sea of people and the ethereal clustered peaks, which is more fitting to call home?\nThough many in Liyue are fascinated by life in Yujing Terrace, its day-to-day operations and rules are a mystery to them.\nThey are aware that the Liyue Qixing are the cream of the crop who hold the fate of the city in their hands, but the calculations and data behind the Qixing's every decision are far harder to grasp.\nThe people understand that the new policies announced each year will change the dynamics of the market, yet none can comprehend how policy is plucked from complex meeting minutes and compiled into something easier on the human eye.\nAs the secretary of Yuehai Pavilion, Ganyu undertakes many tasks that ordinary folk do not see.\nFor those that have witnessed her standing by the dock at daybreak, enjoying her breakfast in silence, it is difficult to imagine her in such a post.\nEven still, by the time the sun has fully risen, she will have returned to Yuehai Pavilion overlooking Yujing Terrace, to continue to fulfill her contract.\nA contract that she signed three thousand years ago with Rex Lapis.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

However, with his dream career turning out to be financially unsustainable by itself, he also took up a job as a guard for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency, primarily escorting goods and people to and from Yilong Wharf. His diligence and friendliness have earned him renown, and he is considered to be the best guard in the agency.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nGaming has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 6 Event Wishes:\nGaming has been included in 1 Chronicled Wish:",
    "lore": "Gaming is a young and energetic man working for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency. He has a very strong work ethic, eagerly completing whatever his clients may ask of him and will fiercely protect their cargo regardless of the situation. He also enjoys Wushou Dances, something which he practices regularly on a daily basis, wanting to become a professional dancer. This practice has made him nimble and proficient in martial arts, despite the numerous injuries he obtains doing so. As such, he is well-liked by the people of Yilong Wharf, who see him as reliable and optimistic.\nIn his youth, his energetic personality made him renowned as a troublemaker and oddball. He is fond of his mother, having picked up her manner of speaking (which includes gesticulations) and carries her letter in a book she gave him, though he misses her dearly after her passing. After being shown a wushou dance by his father, Gaming became inspired to become one himself, causing him to be at odds with his father, who wanted him to continue the family business. This nearly resulted in a fistfight, though he ended up leaving home to fend for himself. His father had only opposed the idea because he felt that the family could provide for him, but after witnessing his show firsthand and a talk with Zhongli, reconciled with him and agreed to let him pursue his own path.\nOutside of work, if not practicing Wushou Dances, Gaming enjoys drinking tea and eating small bites. He does not mind eating any food, as long as they taste natural.\nGaming uses the medium male model. He has golden brown eyes with a light-like glowing ring around the pupils. He has brown hair with red peekaboo dye, pale skin, and a mole on his neck. His hair has a small ahoge at the very top of his head, and his hair is fluffed out in a half-up-half-down.\nIf you happen to hear the sound of drums and  gongs as you're walking through the streets of Liyue Harbor, let your ears lead the way. With a bit of luck, you might just be fortunate enough to  witness a performance of Gaming's remarkable Wushou Dance.\nWhen he puts on his mask, he shakes his head and blinks like a waking  beast. The vast array of emotions he conjures up, the unpredictable twists and turns... Following his every move with rapture, the audience can't help but cheer and applaud.\n\"Thank you for your support, everyone! And remember, if someone you know's thinking of booking a Wushou Dance, don't forget to recommend the 'Mighty Mythical Beasts'!\"\nIt's just a shame that, more often than not, he receives nothing but applause in return. But Gaming doesn't let this get to him — he laughs it off, saying that the audience's attention is all the recognition he needs.\nOnce the crowd has dispersed and his mask is off, Gaming swiftly returns to being a \"guard\" and thinking of work matters once more: How many cargo shipments still need delivering? Which clients does he need to escort? And so on...\nUsually, when there's nothing urgent on, he heads to Xinyue Kiosk to while away the time with some dim sum — a pot of tea, a selection of bite-sized nibbles, and leisurely chatter in the company of good friends.\nAs a guard, the task of escorting goods from Yilong Wharf to Liyue Harbor couldn't be easier for Gaming. But as the head of the \"Mighty Mythical Beasts,\" his dream of making the Wushou Dance a regular occurrence in Liyue Harbor still has a long, long road ahead of it...\nSo in the meantime, why not sit and enjoy another cup of tea?\nGoods flow through Yilong Wharf round the clock, and the merchant convoys and their cargo have need of guards to escort them through the various regions of Liyue to other lands.\nSince ancient times, such escort work has been no easy task. Even in an era of relative safety on the roads such as this, any one escort run could involve any number of variables.\nPerhaps this employer might change the route on an ad hoc basis, or perhaps that customer will nitpick and refuse to accept the goods, never mind how the roads do not lack for all manner of petty crooks if one is fortunate, and big-time bandits if one is not.\nAlthough the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency has no shortage of capable, skilled staff, were you to comb through all their roster, the only one among their ranks who can keep clients happy while beating any brigands down is Gaming.\nThe merchant guilds, for their part, are quite eager to have this young, competent guard to escort their cargo, and Gaming is no less popular on the streets outside of work than he is in his professional capacity. Indeed, any and all friends of this busy fellow will rate him two thumbs up.\n\"It was a piece of cake! Come see our Wushou Dance when you're free! Don't worry, just enjoy the show, and we'll call it even. Thanks in advance, haha!\"\nWhenever someone on the receiving end of his help wants to return the favor, this will be his jocular reply.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

His ears also twitch accordingly depending on what emotion is evoked. If he is particularly happy, his tail begins wagging, something that he considers embarrassing, yet is unable to control and is sometimes oblivious to. He also wishes to be taller and more muscular so that his soldiers can identify him easily on the battlefield.\nHe is fond of sweets due to their rarity in military life, but avoids onions as they make his eyes tear up. This once lead to him crying in front of his men, greatly embarrassing him. He is also fond of mountaineering as it builds strength and camaraderie, expressing a desire to scale Liyue's mountains if he gets the chance to travel there.\nGorou uses the medium male model. He has fair skin, light orange-brown hair with a white section, and teal blue eyes. He has erect pointy ears that are white inside and a bushy tail with a white underside.\nA loyal and brave general of Watatsumi island. Born with a beast-like fighting intuition and tenacious will, he can find a way to victory even in the most critical moments.\nHe leads the Watatsumi troops, who have far fewer military resources compared to the Shogunate. Gorou strives to ensure that the inhabitants of this island will live in safety and peace.\nOutsiders may not be able to imagine that Gorou, someone who faced thousands of enemies on the battlefield, is actually very affable and gets along with all his subordinates.\nIn Gorou's eyes, the people around him are not only his brave soldiers, they are also his beloved companions. They are like treasure to be cared for and protected. The land that sustains us, the comrades who support us, the faith that encourages us to move forward... These are the most precious things for Gorou, to whom he devotes his loyalty and courage.\nWithin Gorou exists a soul as vast and reliable as the earth.\nGorou is the great general of Watatsumi Island's military, and he is deeply loved by his subordinates.\nDuring the period of the Vision Hunt Decree, Gorou led the forces of Watatsumi against the Shogun's Army, and successfully held the line against them.\nThe troops call him the \"ever-victorious pointy-eared general,\" a nickname that has also seen broad use among Shogunate warriors.\nIn private, however, Gorou puts on no airs and is a straightforward person, which has led him to be regarded by all as the man with the plan.\nBut even such an exemplary general must have his fair share of troubles...\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Kazuha is a polite and well-spoken person. Unlike other noble Inazuman clan members, he prefers going out and traveling rather than staying put indoors, something that he is able to do due to the seizure of his clan home. He once roamed Inazuma peacefully as a modest wanderer for a good portion of his life, teaching himself bladework and picking up other skills. Never seeking luxury, he is instead easily pleased just by sleeping on a sun-warmed rock. The time he has spent outdoors makes him attuned to nature and the wind, being able to \"hear\" and \"smell\" everything around him with absolute clarity. He can sense dangers, read people and track them down in an instant no matter how well they try to conceal it. Due to this sensitivity he prefers calm weather and never stays in one place for too long, having trouble sleeping for the former[2][3] and having his skills stagnate for the latter.\nKazuha firmly believes that everyone is entitled to their hopes and dreams and that no one has the right to take them, not even a god. For this reason, he opposes the Raiden Shogun and those who support her. Despite his values, he isn't prideful and can acknowledge the strong fighting prowess and honorable conduct of those he personally disagrees with. He sees his friend's duel as honorable and noble, but also considers his subsequent execution by the Shogun to be both fair and justified.[4] Kazuha is determined in his goals, pursuing them with thoroughness and cunning, but he also takes his time and is easygoing. He is very reflective and thoughtful about all matters, frequently pondering about various topics in his travels. He holds his relationships in high regard, immediately coming out of hiding for his friend and forever grateful to Beidou and Gorou for taking him in when he needed shelter. Kazuha frequently warns others of coming storms and possible trouble. He happily does simple errands, offers advice, and is willing to help others.\nAfter the death of his friend and joining the Crux he was quiet and wouldn't speak to any of his crewmates, but he eventually warmed up to them and according to Beidou is fairly chatty. Kazuha has a poetic side and enjoys penning haikus, though he claims to not be especially talented at it. As a result of both traveling many places and sailing for long periods of time, Kazuha has grown particularly fond of readily available grilled fish and takes the time to prepare and finish his food slowly. While he is not picky about what he eats, he does not appreciate rushed meals or lazy cooking methods. His most prized possession is his sword that he keeps with him at all times, a source of pride for Kazuha as both an Inazuman and a samurai. He is also incredibly fond of red maple leaves, finding them beautiful and enjoys seeing them rain during autumn. When unable to view such sights, he frequently collects and carries them as a memento to ease any homesickness.[3]\nKazuha uses the medium male model. He has platinum blond hair with a single orange-red streak on his right. He has red eyes with a yellow hue at the bottom.\nA wandering samurai from Inazuma with a modest and gentle personality.\nBeneath a youthful and carefree demeanor lies a heart that hides a great many burdens from the past. Seemingly easygoing, Kazuha has his own code of conduct.\nKazuha leads a wandering life, setting out on his journey in the day, and sleeps with the sky as his blanket and earth as his bed in the night. Wealth has never been his pursuit, and regardless of summer or winter, what he seeks has always been true peace in his heart. Despite the wilderness being his home, he never worries about the impending rain or storm. It is as if rainstorms are afraid of him, because they do not dare to cross his path.\nOut of curiosity, someone asked about this talent and Kazuha answered with absolute honesty — reading the sounds of nature is a unique ability of his. People do not usually pay attention to the weather, so it is no surprise that they are unable to discover the signs it reveals. However, given Kazuha's skill, he can sense the arrival of snow and rain immediately with just a gust of wind or abnormal humidity. That is when he knows it's time to seek shelter.\nKazuha, who has traversed around the lands, has avoided countless torrents of storms and flashes of lightning. This time, however, what awaits him will be an unprecedented thunderstorm. This time, he will no longer seek refuge. He, the rain, and the lightning will meet at the intersection of fate, as destiny marks it.\n\"—— I hear a storm strike far and distant, with only a whisper light and faint. From the sky there falls no rain, thus here I shall still remain.\"\nMost people who meet Kaedehara Kazuha for the first time might be inclined to assume that he is just a trainee sailor with the Crux Fleet.\nAfter all, he is a gentle soul who enjoys reciting poetry when idle, and who speaks to everyone in a leisurely manner. Who could tell that he is a wanted man throughout Inazuma?\nEven Beidou, ever the good judge of character, could not tell that Kazuha could wield a sword with the skill of a seasoned warrior when she first decided to take him in.\nWho knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Kaeya is an outwardly confident and charming individual with a flair for drama. He is sometimes seen as overly laid-back and even lazy, but he takes his work seriously. He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of \"top candidate for grandson-in-law.\" His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt — yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people. Kaeya also enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.\nHe seems to get a kick out of telling bold-faced lies and convincing others to do his work, but this serves him well in his role in the Knights of Favonius. He is a self-proclaimed \"anti-hero with an attitude problem;\"[2] as long as everything ends the way he wants, Kaeya does not care about the methods used. Still, according to his informant Vile, he draws the line at working with those who threaten other people's families, believing they deserve to be \"hunted down and destroyed.\"\nDespite his extroversion, the Traveler has observed that he appears to struggle with loneliness, though he playfully deflects when confronted about it.[3] He frequently reminds the Traveler that they can talk to him, invites them to spend time with him, insistently offers (sometimes extensive) assistance, and often voices his disappointment whenever the Traveler has to leave, showing his desire to be helpful and aversion to being alone.\nKaeya uses the tall male model. He has a tanned complexion and navy-blue hair with streaks of lighter blue, accompanied by a waist-length lock of hair that begins at the base of his scalp on the back of his head at the left. His visible eye is periwinkle with a diamond-shaped pupil that is shared with other characters known to be from Khaenri'ah. Over his right eye, he wears a gold-trimmed black eyepatch that is mostly covered by his bangs. Kaeya has not been seen without his eyepatch, but his right eye, which is functional, is implied to have a scar over it due to being wounded by Diluc during their battle after Crepus' death.[4][5]\nNotably, while other Mondstadt characters' Vision casings feature three feathers per wing, Kaeya's Vision on his default outfit only features two feathers. He is also the only one with a wing on the right side of the back of his Vision (other Mondstadt Visions have them on the left side or no wings at all on the back). Kaeya is one of only two characters across all nations who has a Vision with clearly nonstandard casing, with the other character being Furina.\nKaeya Alberich is an adopted son to the Ragnvindr Family, the renowned wine tycoon.\nIt has been a long time since he last called Diluc Ragnvindr \"brother.\"\nKaeya currently serves as the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius, and is trusted by Jean.\nKaeya is often the one wrapping things up in every incident that occurs in Mondstadt's vicinity.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Ayato is a person that does not like to show his face in public often, preferring to work on his duties as the Yashiro Commissioner. A well-known fact about him is that he's extremely busy and stressed, as he has to deal with corrupt government officials while juggling his duty as the leader of the Shuumatsuban. Due to his duties, he loathes small talk, wanting people to get to the point. He uses a large array of methods to deal with corrupt officials, usually within legal bounds.\nWhile he is not particularly well known due to his preference to remain behind the scenes, those who are familiar with him note that he is incredibly kind and has inspired loyalty from many people. For example, Hirotatsu states that he continues to serve the Yashiro Commission to repay the generosity that he showed him and his master and it is strongly implied that Ayato was the one who inspired Thoma to the point the latter received a Vision. Ayato has stated that he highly values loyalty and obedience (hence his preference for dogs), as strongly implied that there were numerous assassinations against him in the past, hence why he values those two traits so much to protect himself from rival clans and organizations.[2][3]\nDespite his succession as the family head at a young age, he appears to be a mature and determined man, notably even more than Ayaka, who's known for her steadfastness. Like Ayaka, Ayato cares for the well-being of the common people. He is also a family man, as he had taken the position of Commissioner per his parents' wishes to also protect Ayaka, stating that he would not forgive any who would harm his family and wanting to ensure that Ayaka had others to rely on when she needed it.[4] He also risked his life to smuggle the Watatsumi Army into Tenshukaku for the sake of doing a \"small favor\" for her.\nAyato is also known to be cunning and mischievous, as both the Shogun and Yae Miko note him as unpredictable and tricky to understand, with the latter strongly disliking him as a result. Nonetheless, he is tolerated by both for upholding the Shogun's will for the former and their duties generally aligning for the latter. Hiratsuka notes that whenever he hangs out with Thoma, he ropes him into eating strange food, causing Thoma to become terrified whenever he sees him. Itto remarks that Ayato is a \"warrior\" with great charisma, and that the two are \"on the same wavelength\". He is also able to find Sayu with ease despite not appearing to have much ninja training, even though the rest of the Shuumatsuban have difficulty locating her.\nAyato uses the tall male model. He has long pale blue asymmetrical shoulder-length hair, pale skin, and light purple eyes. He also has a small mole under the left corner of his mouth.\nAs the head of the Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Ayato is committed to maintaining the prosperity and stability of the region.\nAt a glance, he is low-profile and graceful. He is not a fan of public appearances and does not seek to show his skills overtly.\nBut those who do know him understand that he is not to be underestimated. Long ago, when the Yashiro Commission fell on hard times, and when the Kamisato Clan was on the verge of crumbling, it was this young man who rose to the occasion and stabilized the situation.\nHe could not have achieved his position without extraordinary resourcefulness and cunning. But perhaps, that impenetrable smile belies darker waves.\nHowever, the most intriguing thing is that in most of these negotiations in which he participates, he is not ruthless nor competitive, and is even willing to share the benefits so that everyone can get a relatively satisfactory piece of the pie.\n\"What exactly is he up to?\" is usually what people are thinking after all is said and done.\nHowever, now that everyone has a piece of that pie, perhaps what is on Kamisato Ayato's mind isn't so important.\nAs clan head of the Kamisato Clan, one of the great clans of the Tri-Commission, Kamisato Ayato is a household name in Inazuma.\nHowever, people do not have quite the same clear impression of him as they do of the Shirasagi Himegimi, the elegant and kind Ayaka.\nMost only know that he is an important figure in the Shogunate and the head of a famed noble house. But as for the details, there's little that they can say for sure.\nSome people say that \"the Yashiro Commission's festivals and events are ever meticulous and have been full of consideration for the people. Surely the Commissioner's hand is in all such matters.\"\nBut others also say \"ah, but there is much to politics that should never see the light of day. And how could he have kept such a lofty position without a few tricks up his sleeve, hmm?\"\nAyato himself is unfazed by such comments.\n\"Well, I consider myself merely a serious, dutiful public servant who owes his allegiance to the Almighty Shogun.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Kaveh is a well-known Sumeru architect who graduated from Kshahrewar with honors. He is a staunch defender of the arts and greatly appreciates aesthetics and artistic maturity in most things including architecture, interior designs, mechanics, and even storytelling.[2][3] In contrast to Alhaitham's rationality, Kaveh operates by what he feels to be right, first and foremost.\nKaveh has quite the reputation among Akademiya students and Sumeru citizens and is described as a genius and talented architect. For example, Sasani, an NPC located in The Palace of Alcazarzaray, admires his masterpiece[4] and feels unfortunate for not having the honor to speak with him in person. Araby, an NPC found in front of the Pharos Lighthouse, and Nilou also praise his magnum opus.[5][6] Kaveh is characterized by Faruzan as a good kid with great potential and original ideas in his mind[2] and Dori as being unique among Akademiya scholars in regards to being more open-minded. Alhaitham describes him as a light of the Kshahrewar and a master builder and craftsman. According to Alhaitham's Character Story, Alhaitham acknowledges Kaveh's exceptional brilliance and portrays him as a genius and an excellent mirror of himself. He also concludes that he possesses a personality and values that are not congruous with his abilities.[7]\nKaveh seems to be thoughtful of others and shows great empathy towards people around him. He approaches people without hesitation if he suspects they're in trouble and even lends his hand by providing his Mora.[8] It is mentioned by Alhaitham that he is too considerate of others and is emotionally fragile.[Note 1] Alhaitham even recounts a story where Kaveh purchased a dozens of handmade keychains that were being sold under the pretense that the proceeds would help feed hungry children. Kaveh states helping others make him happy and thinks mutual assistance, fairness, and righteous anger are also what drive the world.[8] He also seems to be very passionate about his career and works his fingers to the bone to please his clients.[9]\nDue to the stark contrast in ideologies and personalities, Kaveh gets easily flustered when particularly dealing with Alhaitham. Kaveh and Alhaitham's clash in intense disagreements are shown in the game scenes, characters' voice-lines, and even in the messages on bulletin boards across Sumeru City and Port Ormos. He is also notably over-reliant on alcohol, using it as a social crutch and as one of the few ways he allows himself to \"drown his sorrows\".\nKaveh uses the tall male model. He has distinct, medium-length blond hair with dirty blond ends and sharp eyes with red irises.\nA renowned architect from Sumeru, known as the Light of Kshahrewar. He is one of the most high-profile figures in the industry.\nAs a designer and an outstanding alumnus, Kaveh has quite the reputation among Akademiya students and is idolized as a role model by the students of Kshahrewar. Unfortunately, his career is not as plain-sailing as people imagine. The same can be said for many other facets of his life.\nTitles, rumors, fame, and reputation... These are all mere by-products of his work. Equipped with astounding professional design skills, Kaveh puts his heart and soul into his work and is imbued with ideals and pursuits for aesthetics and architectonics. Designers are not in charge of the construction's final execution, yet they hold responsibility for all its aspects. Thus, be it design details, safety and security, or practicality, no effort may be spared in ensuring the quality of each aspect. On top of that, being one of the best in his field, Kaveh pays additional attention to the aesthetic and human elements that he is concerned about throughout the process. For him, designs that are completely divorced from reality should be classified as fantasy, whereas a building that is actually put into construction must have practical value.\nThat said, it is rather inconceivable that such an extraordinary architect could have been rendered bankrupt by a single project. Fortunately, very few know about this matter, and most of them keep it a secret. As for Kaveh himself, he is deathly afraid that the secret of his bankruptcy might ever leak out. It is thus fair to say that he is not really living his ideal life.\nIn a land brimming with as much talent as Sumeru, one is practically spoiled for choice when it comes to designers. But when one speaks of architects, few are those who will not subconsciously think of \"Kaveh.\"\nThe Kshahrewar graduate was once named the greatest architect in several decades and is known as the Light of Kshahrewar. Kaveh himself, however, is unfortunately unmoved by this title.\nSuch lovely names and titles are, to him, acknowledgment and shackles both. For example, Kaveh's insolvency remains a matter of shame for him to this day. A person with little to no standing could just admit to such a thing, but a famous architect cannot. In fact, such undue candor might result in a crisis of reputation for him. So, Kaveh cannot but avoid this topic to save face, and be forced to masquerade as a man living in leisure.\nThanks to his abilities as a designer and his astounding aesthetic attainments, people believe in his talent, and thus, in his facade also.\nAfter all, what could possibly trouble Kaveh, architect extraordinaire?\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing. She is a workaholic and is subject to pressure even at her young age. One might attribute her to perfectionism when pertaining to work, causing many of their employees to resign but in reality, she has a strong sense of responsibility and tenaciousness inherited from her grandfather.\nKeqing, unlike most of Liyue, is a great skeptic. She believes that humans should deal with their own problems but it all changed when the Lord of Geo retired from his duties, passing it on to the Qixing. She gained a new respect towards Rex Lapis himself, realizing the magnitude of his work to govern Liyue. As part of her so-called \"self-reflection\", which in reality is a way to hide the newfound respect she has for Rex Lapis, she keeps memorabilia of Rex Lapis. She was also a skeptic of Visions, viewing it as both challenge and insult and once tried to destroy it, all of her attempts failing. She'd then realized the various uses of her Vision and learned to appreciate them.\nShopping is a favorite past time of the Yuheng, often spending her free time with her friends in this sort of activity. Keqing may be an uptight and intimidating character, but she respects and cares for each of her companions close to her. It's only because of her outward image that she's unable to express how she truly feels.\nKeqing uses the medium female model. She has fair skin, amethyst eyes with oval-shaped pupils backed by a shape resembling her stiletto, and waist-length purple hair that turns into silver-purple at the ends.\nThe Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue ⁠— but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.\nOne of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing has an uncompromising belief in actions over words. If she sees something that needs doing, she'll do it herself. For example, she traveled around Liyue and carefully memorized each detail of the land so that she may one day be able to maximize the utility of every last inch of Liyue.\nKeqing deals with the day-to-day affairs of Liyue, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.\nTo many, the millennia of prosperity that Liyue has enjoyed serve to legitimize Rex Lapis' guidance of the city. But Keqing has her reservations about all this, viewing Liyue's present prosperity as akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.\nRex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?\nIt is this unanswered question that drives Keqing to work relentlessly and remain diligent.\nFrom most people's perspective, there is no point in working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit by idly and ignore this hidden danger.\nThe people of Liyue have never considered navigating the future on their own terms. But someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and forge a new path with their own hands.\nFrom most people's perspective, there is no point in working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit by idly and ignore this hidden danger. [sic]\nRex Lapis has brought prosperity and plenty to Liyue Harbor, and his rule and majesty have long passed into show and song, much to the delight of the people. But for someone in such proximity to a god, Keqing seems to lack the requisite respect the most.\n\"Hmph. Let's be real here, but does Morax really know everything?\"\nThe Liyue Qixing deal with the day-to-day happenings in the Harbor, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.\nWhile history has shown that following Morax's lead has been the right call, Keqing believes that humans should have their own pride, and that their views deserve equal importance.\nAs such, she often advocates different opinions from Rex Lapis, and is the first to put such views into practice.\nHer radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.\nAs Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.\nBut someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands — and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Her diligence in ensuring every package would be delivered to the right place has increased her company's renown and hers, making her the sole courier handling international deliveries.[5] She enjoys every delivery she makes as she considers these outings for herself.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nKirara has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 6 Event Wishes:\nKirara has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "Kirara is a youkai who enjoys working at Komaniya Express as she is curious about the world outside Teyvat and enjoys public interactions, seeing them as outings at her own expense. Due to her lack of knowledge about the outside world, she often mistakes others with non-human features or magic users to be other forms of youkai. She enjoys her job and ensures that her customers have a pleasant experience, frequently worried about the prospect of getting fired and having to return to the wilds, which she considers boring.\nAs a nekomata, Kirara often has various feline instincts such as sleeping in boxes, pouncing on small animals and sunbathing on roofs, though she has to frequently suppress these instincts while in her human form to better interact with society. She is notably bad at lying, with any attempts to do so resulting in her tails swaying wildly back and forth.\nKirara uses the medium female model. She is a slim, fair-skinned young woman with pale, ash blonde hair that sticks out in tufts and green eyes. Part of her hair is tied into a high ponytail, and she has a long ahoge in the middle of it. She has a distinct set of two-toned cat tails. As with many other youkai, Kirara has an alternate feline form, though she does not use it as often as it attracts too much attention.\nKomaniya Express, the famous delivery company in Inazuma, has a very special employee working under them. At a glance, she resembles an adorably dressed teenage girl with two tails swaying behind her. Though she treats each of her customers with kindness and generosity, secretly she sometimes takes to running quietly across rooftops to ensure none of her deliveries arrive late...\nThough her obvious nature as a youkai drew more than few comments at first, as Kirara introduced herself with honesty and clarity time and time again while conducting her tasks with dutifulness and effectiveness, people not only dropped all lingering misgivings but even grew grateful for her presence. \"Safe and punctual,\" \"service assured,\" \"vivacious and adorable\"... These three phrases are words most commonly used to describe Kirara on the feedback board. Word is that if you give her a five-star rating or offer her some snacks, you might even see Kirara's face brighten with gratitude as her tails whirl with building joy.\nTo Kirara, her job is as precious as any jewel. She treasures everything about human society and is always overjoyed to behold the smiling faces of her customers. Thus, she gives her all to offer the best service she can for everyone she caters to. After all, if she finds herself fired by the company, all she can do is return being a youkai in the mountains.\nThankfully, her boss at Komaniya Express had never even considered the idea of releasing her. Contrarily, they privately asked Kirara if she wanted higher pay and to transition into comparatively less effortful secretarial work, but Kirara rejected their offer with haste. She didn't have the heart to tell her boss that, to her, every time she leaves to make a delivery, it feels like she's getting to enjoy an outing at the public's expense!\nIf you ask anyone in Inazuma which delivery company is the most reliable, the name \"Komaniya Express\" will surely be mentioned.\nIf you were to continue the line of inquiry and ask just what about their service left the deepest impression, you would see a smile creep onto their lips as they tell you of a certain special courier...\nThat adorable, vivacious young youkai with two twin twirling tails. After you thank her for delivering your package, she will bow deeply while wearing an expression of unadulterated bliss, as though she was the one receiving the gift.\nIf you're willing to spend the time to leave a 5-star rating on the feedback board or give her a few snacks, you may even see stars of joy shoot from this youkai's eyes as her tails swish back and forth.\nAh! But the same people who tell you this will also warn you that this nekomata isn't some weak little thing you can pick on. If you have designs on packages that don't belong to you or get carried away and try to touch her tails... Well, then you'll have to face the consequences.\nAfter hearing all this, it's hard to resist going to Komaniya Express...\n\"Excuse me, I have a package to deliver, and I was hoping the neko—\"\nWithout waiting for you to finish, the owner turns around and shouts \"Kirara! Another one for you!\" as though it were an everyday occurrence.\nAt that moment, a beaming girl will bound towards you, quickly fix her hair and adjust her clothes, and say with a smile—\n\"Welcome, and thank you for choosing Komaniya Express!\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

She adores anything that can blow up like her bombs, such as Amber's Baron Bunny. She acts like a typical energetic young child who loves playing with her friends. Unfortunately, her definition of playing usually involves explosives; she is particularly fond of \"fish blasting\", tossing bombs into lakes full of fish.\nIn part due to her young age, Klee can be very naïve at times and easily confused by topics she doesn't have any context for, such as mistaking Mondstadt's wine industry for a monster,[2] and wondering why Diluc is always grumpy, even going as far as to call him the \"weird grown-up\". Klee is not fond of seeing people argue, as she believes that they only come when someone was in the wrong and that it doesn't feel right to her.[3]\nWhile she's considered an official member of the Knights of Favonius, Klee's antics often get her into trouble. Like any child, she often tries to flee to avoid being reprimanded, but is eventually caught by Jean who sends her to solitary confinement to self-reflect. While she occasionally does try to do so, she almost always quickly forgets and instead uses the time to brainstorm new bombs and explosives.\nKlee loves her fellow knights, and is well-loved by them in turn. She is particularly fond of Kaeya and Albedo. Whenever she heads out of the city to play, she always follows the \"survival rules\" which Kaeya gave her. Albedo, on the other hand, is an older brother figure who takes care of her. She is also quite fond of Diona, even catching fish to share and offering her Dodoco to pet when Klee unintentionally upsets her. She loves her parents, though she does not see them frequently as they often travel around Teyvat and thus have little time to spend with her.\nKlee uses the short female model. She has pale skin, light red eyes, pale blonde hair with a prominent cowlick, and elf ears.[Note 1]\n▌Fleeing Sunlight · Klee\nThe Happy Little Spark... always getting locked up in solitary confinement\n===============================\nIn the streets and back alleys of Mondstadt, it is said that there is a girl in red, who holds an unparalleled treasure within the Knights of Favonius.\nNo matter where or when this girl appears, it's not long before everything goes up in flames.\nWhat's more, as the aftermath of the explosions fades away, she disappears without a trace — there are few who have ever seen her face.\nAmongst the swirling rumors, there are even those that go so far to say that she is the most powerful within the Knights of Favonius.\nThough as far as Acting Grand Master Jean is concerned, using this power for such destruction simply means...\nSolitary confinement's gonna need some upgrades!\nWhen the patrons of Mondstadt's taverns are asked about the strongest knight of the Knights of Favonius, three names are likely to come up:\nThe highly reputable Acting Grand Master Jean, Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and the mysterious tycoon, Diluc.\nHowever, some claim to have witnessed, albeit through bleary, drunken eyes, a knight in red, leveling the entire Stormbearer Mountains.\nIf one wants to find this mysterious knight, then they need look no further than the solitary confinement cell inside the Knights of Favonius Headquarters.\nIf the cell is found vacant... then something explosively unfortunate is likely about to take place...\nKlee is well known for the danger she presents. As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.\nAs a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.\nAfter all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Kujou Sara is a member and adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan, who serves the Raiden Shogun. She supports her Vision Hunt Decree and leads troops to seize Visions. Kujou Sara is also described as a \"tengu warrior\" with \"wings as dark as a raven\".[2]\nBefore the events of the game, Kazuha's friend challenged the Raiden Shogun over her Decree. Kujou Sara accepted the challenge on the Shogun's behalf and prevailed against his friend in the ensuing duel which she came out victorious. Before she could claim his Electro Vision after giving him the Divine Punishment which resulted in the passing of the brave soul, Kazuha, who had just entered to witness his friend's demise, inexplicably snatched it and fled from Inazuma.[3] Sometime later, she defeated Arataki Itto and seized his Geo Vision as part of the decree.\nDespite being an adopted member of the Kujou Clan, Sara is immensely loyal to the Shogun's rule and tirelessly works to create the eternity that the Shogun desires, even if she does not live to see it herself. Those who speak about her note that she has a ruthless, yet efficient and stern attitude, fitting for her position in the Tenryou Commission. Her devotion to the Shogun's cause and her honorable conduct has gained her the respect of those under her command. Compared to other Tenryou generals, Sara participates in battle alongside her men (and head-on attacks as a result) rather than remaining at the back. She despises dishonorable conduct and those who betray the Shogun's will.\nSara's dedication to the Shogun seems to stem from the fact that she believes the Shogun saved her from death when she was bestowed an Electro Vision as she was falling a great height during a battle. This action not only led to her life being spared but to the young tengu being adopted into the Kujou Clan and an unbreakable devotion to the Electro Archon.\nAlthough Sara appreciates Takayuki adopting her, she expresses a sense of loneliness in that she can tell he doesn't truly regard her as family and doesn't treat her the same way he treats his biological children. Kamaji is the only one who treated her as his real sister.\nAccording to Sara, \"five\" is her lucky number; she tends to do stuff in fives, as well as owning five Statues of her Excellency at home. She enjoys quick and easy-filling foods, and secretly likes sweets, but rarely consumes them because they put her mind at ease, which she finds unfitting for her duties.\nKujou Sara uses the tall female model. She has indigo hair cut into an uneven bob, pale skin, and golden eyes. As a tengu, she has two pairs of black raven-like wings that can unfurl from her back; these are seen in one of her idle animations and when she unleashes Subjugation: Koukou Sendou, her Elemental Burst. Additionally, on the side of her head lies a red tengu mask that resembles a crow's face with white accents, a black crest, and a hexagonal piece resembling a tokin.\nLeader of the Tenryou Commission's forces. Bold, decisive, and skilled in battle.\nIf the Almighty Shogun is the sound of thunder that fills the heavens, Kujou Sara is the lightning strike against which her enemies are powerless to defend themselves — and wherever lightning first strikes, terrifying thunder is sure to follow.\nAs the adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan, she conducts herself with an official demeanor at all times. Ask anyone about their impression of Kujou Sara, and they will likely talk of her ruthless efficiency and stern attitude.\nYet this loyal subject of the Shogun is not as cold and indifferent as she seems on the surface. Rather, she has surrendered herself to the demands of her role, her strong sense of duty causing her to put aside her own desires in service of a greater cause.\nFor Kujou Sara, helping the Almighty Shogun to achieve eternity is a paramount goal. She knows that she herself may not be there in the end, but she devotes herself to this mission all the same.\n\"Victory will belong to all of us, even if I am not the last person remaining on the battlefield.\"\nIf people could have only one wish, this would be Kujou Sara's.\nConcealed beneath her icy exterior is a heart that pounds like thunder, where passionate flames burn in secret.\nThe blood of the tengu runs through Kujou Sara's veins, but she does not dwell in the forests and mountains as they do. She was fostered from a young age by the Kujou Clan and has served since then as part of the Tenryou Commission.\nThe Tenryou Commission is one arm of the Tri-Commission, and is in charge of the security of Inazuma. Today, Sara is a general of the Tenryou Commission, and hers is the vital task of maintaining order within Inazuma City itself.\nShe governs well and is ever determined to set a good example for her subordinates. No matter how tough the issue, if it falls under the Tenryou Commission's jurisdiction, Sara can solve it in good time.\nSara smiles little and is swift and resolute in the pursuit of her missions, and so many Inazumans consider her an inaccessible, stone-cold military person.\nHowever, such an assessment might be too surface-level for someone like Sara, who seems cool on the outside but burns within.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Due to her professionalism and certifications, Kuki Shinobu has helped the Arataki Gang out of many problems, and has even expanded the gang's business scope outside of the regular mischief and delinquency.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nKuki Shinobu has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 9 Event Wishes:\nKuki Shinobu has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "Unlike the rest of her family who work as shrine maidens, Shinobu prefers to forge her own path, having tried various trades, studying in Liyue and even joining the Arataki Gang, simply because they allow her to live how she wants — outside and enjoying various experiences, rather than being shackled to the same duties repeatedly.\nShe's a stark contrast to the rest of her group, taking matters seriously and in a generally professional matter. She handles the gang's legal issues and gets them out of trouble and tries her best to compensate for any damages that Itto might have caused with their antics. Her professionalism is noted by the people of Hanamizaka, who go to her for advice on various matters and are left impressed as their discussions with her go smoothly and efficiently. Her being part of the gang also means that the gang is technically qualified to take on certain jobs that the average labourer cannot, even if it's her alone who's doing the work. While the gang is not on good terms with the Tenryou Commission, she gets along well with Kujou Sara, even giving up her Vision to her for the sake of their friendship. Sara believes that Shinobu could achieve greater things, but does think that Shinobu's presence at least helps keep the gang out of worse trouble, which in turn makes less work for the Tenryou Commission to deal with.\nShinobu is on poor terms with her parents, as they had forced her to become a trainee shrine maiden in her youth. She felt that they cared more for her doing a good job and not offending anyone, rather than trusting her to perform well nor caring for her well-being, along with her loathing the job. However, she is still on good terms with her sister Miyuki. She wears a face mask to prevent others from recognizing her (as she was a memorable shrine maiden working with the public) and getting involved in her personal affairs.\nShe is also known to be terrifying when sufficiently angered, often sourced from having her plans disrupted as a result from having to bail out the Arataki Gang from prison. She often uses physical discipline on the gang as a way to discourage further nonsense, causing the gang members to be fearful of her sometimes. On the other hand, Sayu believes that she will disturb her sleep because \"birds of a feather flock together\".\nShinobu uses the medium female model. She has light green hair, pale skin, and narrow reddish-violet eyes. She also has reddish-purple markings on her skin at the sides of her thighs and waist.\nAlthough Kuki Shinobu joined the Arataki Gang at a later stage, she is a powerful figure who transformed the whole gang. After she arrived, the gang's business scope expanded to all walks of life, including but not limited to: legal consultation, business negotiation, banquet catering, clothing customization...\nWhat's even more surprising is that the lackadaisical Arataki Gang was able to produce all the relevant practice certificates, all signed with the same name: Kuki Shinobu.\nIt is said that this second-in-command had studied abroad, and it is also said that she has close affiliations with the Tenryou Commission.\nWhen outsiders hear this, they inevitably have many suspicions. However, the residents of Hanamizaka who often deal with the Arataki Gang are different, and they always go to her for advice on various matters without any reservations.\nIn their opinion, discussions with Kuki Shinobu are always smooth and efficient.\nJust always keep in mind the following two rules:\nOne, do not attempt to find out how she looks like under her mask.\nAnd two, don't ask why she has to steer clear of the Grand Narukami Shrine every time she heads out for a job.\nIn the Arataki Gang, where swaggering commotion is something of an aesthetic, the ever-masked and low-key Kuki Shinobu, the gang's second-in-command, stands out all the more against the backdrop of the other, more clamorous members.\nNo matter what sort of mess the others have gotten themselves into, this deputy is often able to solve their problems in a manner that is both professional and highly efficient.\nMaking some snacks for children who had theirs snatched away, giving scratched lacquerware a new coat of paint, and serving as an advocate for detained comrades...\nSuch are her skills that onlookers often wonder if there is anything that she cannot do.\n\"I wouldn't say that I'm certified for everything. There are some industries that just don't have standardized assessments, so there's no way to sit for any such tests.\"\nHer displeasure finds eloquent expression even behind her mask.\n\"Also, how can there be lines of work where you can find employment without the right qualifications? It boggles the mind.\" Equally mind-boggling, perhaps, is the fact that her deep puzzlement is just as contagious.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Despite these traits, Layla is unusually perseverant, having outlasted several of her classmates who had joined at the same time as her.\nLayla's lack of sleep is so severe that she ends up sleepwalking in the night, where an alternate personality manifests. This persona is energetic and determined, helping solve all of her problems (who dubs the present Layla as \"Daytime\") in an instant.

    "lore": "Compared to her siblings Lyney and Freminet, Lynette is the most reserved of the three. She rarely talks to others out of her own accord, letting Lyney do the talking for her, and dissuades essentially any attempt to speak with her by saying bizarre responses. Whenever she needs to talk, she speaks briefly and frankly.\nDue to a rare case of atavism, Lynette has feline features and traits, such as enjoying fish. She also has a habit of breaking and/or damaging machines, resulting her not using them frequently. Lynette enjoys making and drinking tea, though her sensitive tongue results in her having to cool it down first before drinking.\nAs a result of her traumatic past with Lyney, Lynette does not trust most people lest they take advantage of them, seeing her brother as a truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods. Like Lyney, she keeps her ties with the Fatui discreet.\nLynette uses the medium female model. She is a young woman with violet eyes, pale skin, and ash blonde hair tied into a low, thin ponytail which extends down her back. She has blunt bangs swept to her left, a short braid along the right side of her head, and two sections of hair which frame her face, curling inwards towards her chin. Additionally, she has cat-like ears, and a cat's tail. She also has a small, dark brown star-shaped mark on her left cheek, mirroring her brother's teardrop mark on his opposite cheek.\nIn direct contrast to her older brother, who refers to himself as \"the greatest magician in all Teyvat\", Lynette might possibly be the lowest-profile Magician's Assistant in the land.\nShe seeks neither flowers nor applause, avoids interviews, and generally tries to avoid notice.\nWhether people are trying to attract her attention or simply curious, she shuts them out with bizarre responses like \"Entering Standby Mode\" and \"I need to space out.\"\nEven when bigwigs from the audience pay them a private visit, Lynette always takes a back seat and lets Lyney do the talking. She prefers to brew a pot of tea and sit in the corner, looking down as she quietly sips away, apparently uninterested by the conversation.\nOnly the very few among them, in the briefest of interludes, sense for a millisecond that they are being secretly watched. But by the time they try to locate the source of the gaze, it has already vanished without a trace.\nYet the only other people in the room are Lyney – warm and hospitable as ever – and Lynette, whose undivided attention is being bestowed upon a teacup.\n...Perhaps it was just their imagination.\n...But even if not, what harm could a quick glance have done? It's not like they could have seen anything of any significance... could they?\nIn their little team of three at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete, Lynette plays an essential role in making sure that their work runs smoothly. When Lyney's bold nature clashes with Freminet's cautiousness, instead of taking sides, Lynette stands back and analyzes the situation in a calm and collected manner. She resolves their disputes by helping them find a middle ground.\nShe's generally very quiet and is in the habit of constantly observing other members of her \"family.\" If Lyney accidentally cut his finger in the middle of a performance, or Freminet suddenly looked downcast, Lynette would make a mental note of it. When she had a suitable opportunity, she'd be there with a bandage or a cup of tea.\nShe loves her \"family\" and her \"family\" love her. Waking up by the fireplace, she's become accustomed to the familiar sight of Lyney at the table practicing card tricks and Freminet cleaning the living room. It was in such a moment that she suddenly realized how long it had been since the memory of those sleepless nights of fearful anticipation had vanished — just like a lump of coal that had burned itself into oblivion.\nWhen asked who the most famous magician in the Court of Fontaine is, audiences will almost certainly think of the stylish, vibrant Lyney and his stage presence.\nBut if you were to ask after its most renowned magic assistant, people would scratch their hands and be at quite a loss to answer.\nThe adulation is not for her, after all, nor is the resounding applause directed at her skill and presence. As an assistant, she needs only misdirect the audience at opportune moments, ensuring the spotlight stays on the protagonist.\nWhether on or offstage, Lynette habitually hides behind Lyney, in shadows that neither lights nor compliments can penetrate.\nFor an assistant, keeping a low profile is a professional matter.\nAnd as for a child of the \"House\"... being cloaked in shadow is how one survives.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Lyney is a skilled magician who enjoys the showlight. He is, at first sight, very easygoing and friendly compared to his siblings Lynette and Freminet, who are reserved and introverted respectively, though he is said to be much quieter when alone with his sister. He and his sister are talented magicians, having learned from Cesar in their youth when they were living on the streets. Lyney remembers all of the people that he is indebted to and will repay their kindness, as shown with Arlecchino, Cesar, Chiori and the Traveler.\nThough it is not said directly, it is implied that he does have some feline traits like his sister such as his eyes, his love for fish and a wish to sleep more in the morning. His tendency to be both intimate yet reserved also gives him a mysterious aura often related to cats. His constellation also has the word \"cat\" in it, just like Lynette. However, these traits are not as pronounced as his sister, as he appears just like a normal person and does not share her increased senses of hearing, taste and smell.\nHe cares greatly for his siblings, wanting to ensure that they have a home to live in and looks out for them whenever possible, becoming extremely irrational should their safety be threatened. This is to such an extent he would even be willing to face his own \"Father\" in a duel, knowing he could never beat her.  Despite all his cheer, Lyney has a dark and traumatic past with his sister, but they have a very good relationship, likening it to the only truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods. As a result, he is willing to do anything to stay with her. Lyney is also implied to quite prideful, wanting to prove himself to others.\nLyney uses the medium male model. He is a young man with violet eyes, pale skin, and short ash blond hair, some locks being pulled back in a small braid on the left side of his head. He also has bangs with a small pinkish red strand on the right, covering almost a quarter of his face. Additionally, he has cat-like eyes thanks to their overall shape and their slit pupils. He also has a dark brown tear-shaped mark on his right cheek.\nWith the possible exception of the trials held at the Opera Epiclese, Lyney and Lynette's magic show is without a doubt the best live performance in the Court of Fontaine.\nJudgment uses truth to deliver justice. Magic uses facade to reach people's hearts.\nEven if the whole audience knows that everything that takes place on stage is simply trickery and deception, they'll still be dazzled when they're brought face to face with a miracle. Long before the magician's elegant curtain call, the thunder of the cheering and applause will be deafening.\nOn stage, Lyney is a Great Magician in the eyes of all. Off stage, he's a reliable older brother, courteous visitor, and devoted friend.\nHis every move is a pleasant surprise, every word a reason to smile. His whole being is like an indecipherable enigma that you just can't help trying to solve.\nIf you suddenly find yourself so close to him that you're confiding your innermost thoughts, don't be too surprised.\nAfter all, what is a magician if not an expert in stealing hearts?\nMagic is a lie. Nothing but evasion, deception, and trickery.\nEven a single illusion requires a series of lies to pull off. To put on a whole magic show, you must win the audience's trust by weaving a seamless facade of ruses and ploys.\nProps, lighting, assistants, planning... the stage is set through the help of countless aids, both onstage and off. A magician's performance rests upon so much painstaking effort, yet is also weighed down by the burden of expectation.\nAs such, a magician's design must be absolutely airtight, and his execution without flaw — even a single slip-up could ruin everything. He must not let his \"family\" down...\n\"...The magician's lies must not be exposed.\"\nThe first time Lyney stepped onto the stage, he had a mission on his mind as he stood there behind the curtain, muttering \"Father's\" words under his breath.\n\"Lyney...\" said Lynette as she squeezed her brother's palm unconsciously.\nThe curtain slowly began to rise, marking the start of their performance. Lyney raised up Lynette's arm and gazed back at her with a determined look in his eyes.\n\"I'll be alright — because as always, Lynette's by my side.\"\nThe people of Fontaine love their tales of mystery. The intricate case setups and unexpected twists and turns are captivating for all.\nMagic recreates this experience under the converging spotlights. For the price of a ticket and some of your free time, you can embark on a wondrous journey amidst thunderous applause and astounded cries.\nIf you were to ask around as to which of Fontaine's \"guides\" is best at setting up such fantastical tours, most fans will tell you that it is Lyney.\nSuave, romantic, and talented, he performs miracle after miracle with a casual air.\nIn this industry, one needs only a stable of staple tricks to ensure a renowned reputation and comfortable life.\nHowever, Lyney's shows always feature some new trick. Some say that he was born into poverty, and the resultant burning hunger for fame and fortune drives his boundless desire to create.\nIn truth, he simply pursues novelty in his capacity as a performer — indeed, he feels that if he cannot put his whole heart into the show, his deep desire to perform cannot be fully satiated.\nThis is why, despite the applause rising to a fever pitch and beyond, he will rarely satisfy the crowd's calls for a reprise of his most well-known tricks. Some devoted fans consider this to be a bit of a shame...\n...And for them, such regret will only continue to increase each time they purchase a ticket and go in to watch his show.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Seemingly shy and distant at first, Mika eventually warms up to the people he knows. To those unfamiliar to him, especially those with high rankings, Mika prefers to observe them and understand their personalities before properly interacting with them as a sign of respect.[2] He does seem to rely on other people for decisions, such as when to talk or what to say.[3]\nDespite his young age, Mika is mature and responsible, taking care of his older brother when he comes home drunk and completes his tasks without complaining or having much issue with them. He enjoys cartography, wanting to become Mondstadt's expert cartographer and expressing a desire to map all of Teyvat. While friends with Klee, he often has to remap due to her explosives altering the landscape, though he does not mind.\nMika uses the medium male model. He has fair skin, blue eyes, and curled golden hair that sticks out in irregular tufts and are golden brown at the tips.\nMika, who is a member of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company, always diligently fulfills all the duties that come his way.\nSetting up tents, lighting fires for cooking, repairing equipment... Even Hertha, the logistics captain, has nothing but praise for Mika's excellent efficiency.\nMika's dedication to work is not due to a weak character or his inability to say no, but instead stems from the value that he attaches to teamwork, and a genuine desire to learn from his experienced colleagues.\n\"Helping everyone as much as possible benefits the entire team too!\"\nMika's favorite pastime is closely linked to his primary duty as a front-line surveyor.\nThat is: surveying unexplored regions, recording topographical data, and drawing accurate and effective maps.\n\"There is an abundance of resources here, but it is surrounded by monsters. Take note to exercise caution.\"\nMika, whose dream is to become an expert cartographer, adds another annotation to the new version of the military map he is designing.\nWhenever he shows up at the Knights of Favonius headquarters, Mika always swiftly finishes any discussions to be had with his fellow knights, then quietly slips away to avoid becoming a hindrance to others' work.\nMika always gets nervous when someone strikes up a conversation with him, frantically scampering away right after politely putting an end to the idle chatter.\nThe knights know that the young man's name is Mika, and that he is Huffman's younger brother and the second son of the Schmidt family. They also know that he is a member of the Reconnaissance Company, but nothing much beyond that.\nFew are aware of what Mika's job entails, nor do they know that the widely-promoted, updated version of their military map is the fruit of his labors.\nThe new map consists of detailed statistical data regarding almost every corner of Mondstadt with practical markers indicating road conditions, areas with heightened monster activity, high ground that can serve as temporary strongholds, and the distribution of natural resources... The amount of detail could almost make your head spin.\nAll of this is the result of Mika's own labor throughout the two years he has spent traveling all across Mondstadt and investigating every inch of terrain he set foot on.\nKnights who have fought alongside Mika know that he finds using both lance and crossbow at the same time the most convenient, and his unique fighting style has left a lasting impression.\nHowever, they have also been solemnly \"warned\" by Mika to never speak of him to others unless absolutely necessary.\n\"Mika's terrified of drawing the attention of others — he'll get nervous if you so much as stare at him, to say nothing of showering him with compliments. He's been a great asset to the Knights and helped us out a lot, so respecting his boundaries is the least we can do as seniors!\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Mona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects, yet also fears Barbeloth, her master, at the same time. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is.\nBeing obsessed with astrology gives Mona a sense of pride, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any Mora she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost. She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, occasionally going without shelter or food for days on end. She is particularly picky when it comes to eating, as she prefers simple dishes when eating out; when she cooks, she makes the most out of whatever she can buy.[2] She does not tolerate those who disrespect her.[3] She also makes a lot of denials when someone is pointing out what she doesn't have.\nMona uses the medium female model. She has fair skin, pale sea green eyes, and waist-length dark purple hair that turns slightly red at the ends. Her fringe is uneven.\nMona is unique among astrologers — others may speak with great ostentation for money, but Mona has never done so. Nor does she dress up or mince her words, even if her results are unpleasant to hear: \"You won't amount to anything even if you join the Adventurers' Guild.\" \"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you\" — such is the nature of her rejoinders.\nHer blunt nature has resulted in plummeting numbers of people coming to have their fortunes told. But Mona isn't one to complain, for that just leaves her with more time for her personal research.\nBut when one speaks of research, one also speaks of the necessity of purchasing texts and research apparatus. Mona's only income comes from her contributions to The Steambird's \"All Things Astrological\" column. Every paycheck is spent first on her research. Books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... all of these come with a hefty price tag, and by the time Mona regains her senses, there's only enough of her income left for her to scrape by each month.\n\"It matters not. Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them.\" So says Mona, coughing loudly all the while to cover the sound of her growling stomach.\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries about Mora.\nTeyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business. Merchants move products, knights patrol, and farmers till the land.\nBut if one were to ask Mona — the enigmatic and prideful astrologist — what she busies herself with, she will reply by saying that she is servicing a debt known as \"life.\"\nShe will, however, vigorously deny being \"poor,\" giving the following explanation:\n\"Beautiful veneers may obscure simple truths.\nExquisite food may mask its nutritional value.\nOne lives simply, all the better to expose this world's truths.\"\nA frugal lifestyle, therefore, is a form of training to access the truth... Or so Mona will insist.\nTeyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers.\n—That said, it seems like bards might be the exception to this rule.\nFriendship Lv. 2  •  Beyond This World's Stars"

    "lore": "When the Traveler and Paimon first encountered Nahida during the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, she was an elusive and secretive figure. Until then, she had chosen to leave the city's governance to the sages, but decided to intervene when they stepped out of line. Her self-esteem was significantly negatively affected due to the way the sages treated her. However, after the sages' downfall and the cleansing of Irminsul, many of these negative traits diminished or disappeared. Now, she openly roams the city in her free time, engaging with her people and exhibiting a much more cheerful outlook on herself.\nDespite her earlier struggles, Nahida rarely expressed her sadness when speaking to others. She consistently maintains a gentle and kind demeanor and treats everyone as equals. However, she acknowledges that her social skills and understanding of human interaction need improvement, which is evident in her slightly eccentric speech and behavior. She has a fondness for analogies and often uses them to explain concepts to others. She believes in guiding people to discover answers on their own, especially regarding complex truths, rather than simply providing the answers. This tendency leads her to incorporate a mix of analogies and subtle clues into her conversations to steer people into reaching the conclusions she hopes they would.\nAs the God of Wisdom, Nahida's most prominent qualities are her exceptional intelligence, extensive knowledge, and strategic planning. She is capable of devising thorough, multi-layered plans and can even be somewhat manipulative when necessary, as demonstrated during her dealings with Dottore. Perhaps most notably, Nahida excels at discerning when her intelligence is required and when kindness is needed—or when both are appropriate.\nNahida uses the short female model. She has fair skin, pointed ears, large green eyes, and white hair with Dendro-green tips that glow when she uses her Elemental Skill or her Elemental Burst.\nLesser Lord Kusanali dwelt deep in the Sanctuary of Surasthana. She had never really been in the limelight, nor had she even been mentioned much.\nAlways learning something new, she constantly strove to become a worthy archon who could guide her people as soon as possible.\nIf the threat of forbidden knowledge were not pressing so near, would she not desire to take a short break and see Sumeru and those who live in it with her own eyes?\nAs things stood, she could only see the myriad, vibrant sights the world had to offer in dreams.\nWithin the meditative silence of her soul, she made companions of the sunlight and the breeze, struck up friendships with humans and animals, told stories, played, and sang songs she had only just learned...\nShe poured the loveliest of yearnings into her dreamscape, but no matter how bustling the nights, when day came, all things about her would return to silence once more.\nShe gradually arose. Even through her sleepiness, solitude struck like an icy tide, causing her to hug her shoulders tightly.\n—That which fully awakened her was an inconspicuous yet abnormal noise that sounded within Akasha.\n\"Ah. So it was a dream within a dream...\"\nSeveral of Nahida's Character Stories change after completing the Archon Quest Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies. See the Altered Character Stories section for the alternate versions.\nGreater Lord Rukkhadevata created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through the Akademiya. Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.\nOn the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.\nBut the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.\nFrom the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.\nThe Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.\nThrough the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that \"The God of Wisdom will never come back.\"\nShe knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.\nThus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

While Neuvillette upholds the rules of the court with utmost reverence, he is quite aloof when dealing with human emotions and often distances himself from the public eye.\nDespite his human appearance, he is actually the Hydro Dragon and one of the Seven Sovereigns. However, he did not obtain full dragonhood until the events of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty when the Hydro Archon Focalors returned the powers stolen by the Heavenly Principles from the Sovereigns back to him.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nNeuvillette has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 3 Event Wishes:\nNeuvillette has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "In accordance to his role as the Chief Justice, Neuvillette takes the court and trials very seriously, handing out verdicts with impartiality. He is notably perceptive, being able to hear Paimon's whispers and is able to deduce the additional details from the evidence provided to him during a trial. He utilizes the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale to make the final decision, honoring its request regardless of his own feelings on the matter as per protocol.\nDue to his position and ties to the Hydro Archon, he is popular among Fontaine's people as a symbol of justice and honor. As a member of the Seven Sovereigns, Neuvillette is unfamiliar with human customs and feelings, using the court to help him process and understand them. He rarely spends his time out in public, as he does not enjoy unwanted attention, and in the few times he speaks to humans, he appears to be aloof, though honest in his words. However, when interacting with Melusines, he is extremely friendly, seen as the ideal father by them; likewise, he is fiercely protective of them, considering them the pride of Fontaine and investigating matters himself should he hear of a Melusine being bullied or threatened. This stems from his failure to protect his friend and subordinate, Carole, when she was driven to death due to Fontainian's prejudice, and Neuvillette being forced to sentence his other friend, Vautrin, for carrying out a revenge killing for Carole, he had since resolved to prevent such tragedy from happening ever again.\nWhen he was initially reincarnated, Neuvillette was left with many questions about himself, leading to him accepting a position as the Iudex. His time overseeing trials led him to experience a plethora of human experiences and emotions, which was secretly prepared by Focalors in the hopes that his newfound perception would save the people of Fontaine from a looming prophecy that would exterminate them. Upon learning the full extent of Focalors' deception, he admitted that she was devious and was both saddened and shocked by her self-sacrifice. Indeed, having seen humanity positively, Neuvillette used his fully restored powers to save the people and left aside fragments of his power in the form of Visions for those worthy of them.\nNeuvillette opposes the Heavenly Principles, and by extension The Seven, as they usurped the authority of the Dragons that once ruled Teyvat. This appears to be more of a professional standpoint than a personal matter, as he expresses surprise at the current status of some Archons, like Barbatos, while respecting Lesser Lord Kusanali for her duties.\nNeuvillette enjoys water and is an avid taster, being able to discern the properties of where the water came from and how it's prepared; as a result, this also extends to him liking food with plenty of sauce. He does not like deep fried food and grilled food with no sauce, especially taking great offence to Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cakes.\nNeuvillette uses the tall male model. He has pale skin, purple-shaded slit eyes, pointed ears, and waist length white hair with a single lock that has a blue underside. He also has what appears to be two bright, blue horn- or feeler-like accessories at shoulder length.\n\"Given that our previous behind-the-scenes editorial on the Hydro Archon earned us the honorable epithet of 'tabloid journalism' from our dear Monsieur Neuvillette, this time we'll be focusing on the mysterious Iudex himself. We know little indeed of his true character, and sadly our multiple requests for an interview were all turned down. Instead, we have decided to reach out and draw upon the wisdom of the masses. In the pursuit of the truth, all anonymous submissions and attestations of manifestly questionable veracity have been filtered out. We were rather intrigued, however, by the following letter written in a particularly adorable script:\n...\n\"If the Darknight Hero really does exist, he's probably just someone in disguise. When he gets up in the morning to brush his teeth, it's the real him. Only in the dead of night does he become the Darknight Hero. But not (Monsieur) Neuvillette. The Chief Justice IS the real him. For us Melusines, our ideal of the perfect father — that's also the real him. The only person that isn't really him is the one that goes by the name of Neuvillette.\"\nFrom this, we can safely surmise... that Neuvillette must be the only male Melusine! Granted, the Melusines actually appeared much later than when Neuvillette took up his post. But in the face of such ironclad evidence, there's bound to be some way of explaining this!\"\n— Seven Nations Gazette, a notorious tabloid\nNeuvillette is a solitary person.\nFontainians who have tried to get close to him have, without exception, been politely rejected. To this day, no one even knows his first name, since he has always asked that he be referred to by his last name.\nHe believes that close personal ties will lead to suspicions about the justness of one's judgments, while he must remain a symbol of absolute justice.\nOf course, there will always be people who just won't give up. They will say, \"Come now, Monsieur Neuvillette. Not everyone will stand trial, nor will you always have to remain in the judge's seat.\"\nBut is that really the case? If there is an answer in his heart, Neuvillette will not reveal it.\nGiven enough time, every river will overflow and flood. Every last Fontainian is guilty, with judgment and doom certain to one day fall upon them — this is neither metaphor nor rhetoric.\nYet, Neuvillette can share this fact with no one.\nTruly, he is a lonesome person.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Noelle is a polite young woman and professional maid, helping those in need without hesitation, regardless of how far they are or what they need done, as long as they say her name. She has a very high standard of work ethic, as she always strives to ensure that everyones' needs are satisfied and always makes the effort to go over their expectations. No work is a problem for her; Lisa believes that the more work she is given, the happier she is.[2] Despite her appearance, Noelle is terrifyingly strong; she is able to brawl with Lawachurls single-handedly[3] and has difficulty finding a suitable weapon, as most claymores break in her hands, even moreso with swords.[4]\nDespite her work ethic, Noelle is relatively stubborn and inexperienced; she states that she is useless in an argument and simply does what she believes is best, regardless of the other party's advice. Likewise, her attempts to meet everyone's needs is double-edged; although most people are genuine, others can take advantage of her generosity. Jean also considers her to be eligible for the Knights, but refrains from knighting her because she is worried that she is not ready for what lies outside Mondstadt.[5]\nShe looks up to all of the Knights and asks them for advice on how to be a proper member when she officially joins, regardless of how much experience they may have, such as the rambunctious Klee. Her aspiration of joining them means that she will refuse any other invitations offered to her.[6]\nNoelle uses the medium female model. She has short, neck-length pale gray hair with a straight fringe and lopsided locks of hair framing her face. A section of hair is braided over her bangs and pinned down at the right side of her face with a gold shield clip. Her eyes are olive green.\n▌Maid of Favonius · Noelle\nA Maid's Job Knows No Bounds\n========================\nMany people in Mondstadt think there's something a little bit magical about Noelle: She seems to have the ability to be everywhere at once, and to do absolutely anything she sets her mind to.\nWhether it's a Knights of Favonius dinner party, a winery banquet, or just an ordinary barbecue, Noelle is a whirlwind of helpfulness that will burst through your door at the first sign of a problem and whisk it away for you.\nIt's no wonder that people have taken to calling her the \"Wondermaid.\"\nBut ask Noelle and she'll tell you there's nothing wondrous about the way she works, let alone magical. She just takes pride in her work and is constantly in pursuit of perfection.\n\"Nothing more, nothing less. Just as it should be, and not as it should not be.\"\nNoelle has much greater dreams and ambitions than other maids in the Knights of Favonius.\nLike anyone else in this city protected by the Knights of Favonius, she too dreams of donning the honored armor.\nEven if her skills are not enough to pass the rigorous selection trials, she still wishes to observe and learn from them every chance she gets.\nAside from her training, she enjoys her current life, helping everyone in need.\n\"You can leave absolutely anything to me!\"\nThat's her signature line.

    "lore": "Qiqi has a quiet yet polite demeanor when dealing with customers at the pharmacy. As a zombie, Qiqi has trouble retaining memories and can quickly forget about people if she doesn't continually reinforce herself with an impression of them, using her Vision to protect those she holds dear. Due to her undead nature, Qiqi has a relatively dull tone of voice and cannot convey most of her emotions to others, nor does she have a sense of smell. Despite her stoicness, she retains a sense of childlike naivety, as she believed coconut milk to have come from an animal, even dubbing said fictional creature the \"cocogoat\". She prefers cold weather, as the heat reminds her of death, and her flesh begins to decay if she stays too long in such places.\nAlthough zombies have to be issued orders when awoken, because Qiqi had done so herself, she is a rare case. She has to give herself orders to perform her duties. These duties cannot be canceled, and she must either finish the task or be forced to cancel it by hugging her with enough sincerity. She takes her responsibilities seriously, carrying a notebook in which she details everything she needs to do for the day, which also serves as a reminder in case she forgets something. She also strives to improve herself, so she becomes less forgetful. However, some days, she may forget to check on her notebook.\nWhile she generally gets along with everyone, she loses it whenever Hu Tao comes or is mentioned, remarking that she has a \"punchable face\" and despises her, expressing an intent to throw the director into the fridge due to her insistence on sealing her away. This has happened so often that Qiqi began to remember and fear Hu Tao, even memorizing hiding places to avoid her. Even after giving her an exception and pampering her, Qiqi still holds a grudge against Hu Tao.[2] Although Qiqi works for Baizhu, she can never remember his face, which she does not mind since she is aware that he has ulterior motives toward her.\nQiqi uses the short female model. She has pale skin, magenta-colored eyes, and light purple hair that is chin-length except for a section at the back of her head that goes down past her hips.\nDespite being a zombie, Qiqi claims to be in better shape than her boss, Baizhu. She performs calisthenics daily to prevent rigor mortis from setting in, which would otherwise force her to continually hop around to move.\nAn apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy, Qiqi is an undead with a bone-white complexion.\nShe seldom has much in the way of words or emotions.\n\"Blessed\" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie retains her original appearance as a child. Who knows how old she really is...\nZombies must have orders before they can do anything. Somehow Qiqi ended up responsible for giving orders to herself.\nQiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook.\nDespite how problematic her memory may be, she is actually quite well-equipped to get through the day: she can use orders to force herself to complete tasks; if she forgets anything, she can look at her notebook for a reminder; and if any task proves difficult, her incredible strength can help solve many problems.\nRecently, she has also added a section on \"brain training\" and \"mnemonic methods.\" Her notebook is becoming a true \"dummy's guide\" on just about anything.\nBut on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...\nIf while in the mountains of Liyue you see someone bumping into things, walking in circles, or chasing squirrels that don't exist, it is almost certainly to be the adorable undead herb gatherer. If she seems to be struggling, please lend a helping hand!\n\"I am Qiqi. I am a zombie. And I forgot what comes next.\"\nAn apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy.\n\"Blessed\" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie cannot do anything without first giving herself orders to do it.\nQiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook in which she writes anything important that she is sure to forget later.\nBut on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...\nDue to being a zombie, Qiqi lacks facial expression. She hopes that's okay.\nShe may look like a zombie, but she's surprisingly limber due to a strict calisthenics regimen.\nHer memory is poor. She forgets easily, and that is partly why she can seem cold to others.\nHer appearance is forever frozen at the point of her passing, so estimates of her age are unreliable.\nZombies require orders to act, but due to some reason or another, Qiqi is presently giving herself orders.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity — a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.\nThe Raiden Shogun exists in two forms — Ei, her true identity, and the Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to oversee Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia. This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely difficult to modify. The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation.[2] In none of her voice lines does she ever use contractions (eg. \"it's\", \"can't\"). The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant[3] and carries out her creator's exact will, unable to act on her own volition. If her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes ineffectual. Due to limited protocols as a result of Ei's initial indifference towards anything other than \"eternity\", the puppet is able to be manipulated by external influences. For example, the Kujou Clan and Fatui persuaded her into initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.\nWhile Ei has a more stern demeanor than the average person, she is notably more emotive and sociable than the Shogun. Unlike the Shogun, Ei has preferences, such as a love for sweets and passion of martial arts. Due to her dedication to eternity, Ei maintains a wary attitude on the idea of change. However, she demonstrates curiosity rather than disdain towards new affairs, such as the appearance of the Traveler[4] and the customs of the modern world.[2] Due to having lost many of her loved ones over the centuries, Ei is driven by a fear of further loss, wanting to preserve Inazuma. To this end, she previously sealed herself in the Plane of Euthymia to keep herself from the effects of erosion. She created the puppet Shogun to ensure immunity from the decay of her physical body.[4] While in the Plane of Euthymia, Ei was indifferent to anything that did not affect her pursuit of eternity and had a low opinion of human ambition due to it resulting in loss and suffering and therefore, making it incompatible with eternity.[5] While in the Plane of Euthymia, she was not unmoved by loneliness, as Ei is shown enjoying Yae Miko[5] and the Traveler's company.\nIn spite of her flawed actions, Ei is devoted to Inazuma, simply longing to protect it and her people. After she is convinced that her actions were destructive, Ei shows remorse and is willing to change her perspective regarding eternity to become a better ruler. She also gained a newfound respect for the idea of human ambition and its achievements.\nThe Raiden Shogun uses the tall female model. She has pale skin, purple eyes with light blue pupils, and long, dark violet hair that becomes lighter at the ends, which glow when she uses her Elemental Skill or her Elemental Burst. She also has a beauty mark below her right eye.\nThe undisputed supreme ruler of Inazuma.\nHer Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, promised the people of Inazuma an unchanging eternity to last throughout the ages.\nAfter purging all sentiment with merciless lightning, the solitude of her mind became a secluded space free from mortal joys and woes...\nOver the long years, the road to eternity has been dark and desolate, but Her Excellency the Shogun has never wavered, not even for a moment.\nFor true unchanging eternity is found only in the stillness that manifests itself when all noise is stripped away.\nSince the dawn of life, humankind has always borne an intense yearning for and curiosity about the world. This is the anchor point of their cognition and is the foundation of all reason.\nThe world of the people of Inazuma is also thus. There, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain were primordial facts of life, as well as light, and the sea... and the Raiden Shogun.\nBabes nestling in their mothers' arms hear tales of the Shogun's slaying of many gods and conquering of other races.\nWhen young men and women roam the islands, they see the gorge split asunder by a blade of lightning and the pale, still-standing bones of the giant snake.\nSoldiers take to the battlefield with \"glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!\" upon their lips.\nThe people work in contentment and peace, knowing that the Shogun and her loyal Tri-Commission are there.\nThe great name of the Raiden Shogun has long shaken off the shackles of mere life, becoming the eternal traditional belief of Inazuma.\nPeople trust in this great name and its might, believing that their descendants shall witness the same sights, that the same faith will form the foundations of their inner worlds, and that this will pass on from generation to generation.\nThis is the eternal paradise that the Almighty Shogun promised her people.\nFriendship Lv. 2  •  Omnipresence Over Mortals"

He loves his wolf family, but dislikes the fact that he isn't fully like them, being an infant taken in by the leader of his pack, Boreas. While he barely sees any fellow humans traveling in Wolvendom due to its fearsome reputation, he considers the few humans he does encounter to be his friends and is willing to protect them from danger if it means sacrificing his and his pack's dinner for the night. Razor is also a quick thinker, as he is able to fix Klee's disasters whenever she goes to play in Wolvendom.[2]\nRazor is honest and forthright, due to his limited exposure to human life.

Like Fischl, her intuition is very keen, as she's well aware that Diluc, Kaeya, Venti and Albedo are more than what they appear to be.\nDespite her position in the church, Rosaria is the least devout; she is always guaranteed to skip all church activities when possible and the first one to leave if she is forced to attend.[2] While she does recite prayers, she does not remember Barbatos' name due to her lack of devotion, frequently mispronouncing his name.[3]\nSecretly, she acts as a purveyor of justice for the Church, investigating potential threats to Mondstadt and eliminating them if necessary. She is particularly skilled in killing, having been taught by her former \"family\", a group of bandits before they had been wiped out by the Knights of Favonius.[2] Due to being offered a chance for redemption by Grand Master Varka, Rosaria sees herself differently to the people of Mondstadt,[2] and is indebted to them for their unselfish warmth and goodwill.[4]\nRosaria uses the tall female model.

    "lore": "As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, Kokomi handles almost all of the affairs on the island herself. While she is not content with such a burden, having preferred to be a military advisor, she nonetheless takes the mantle to give her people the hope and happiness they deserve. Like Jean, Kokomi easily burns herself out completing her tasks and tries to keep it hidden from others to avoid worrying them.\nAlong with handling all sorts of affairs, Kokomi is a skilled strategist that thinks of all potential scenarios and how to handle them as a result of reading plenty of military books, although she also enjoys casual reading. Kujou Sara remarks that her planning prevented the Tenryou Commission from claiming full victory over the Watatsumi Army. She continues this habit even outside of military affairs. As a result of the role she plays, she is universally beloved by her people.\nKokomi uses the medium female model. She has long, pale salmon pink hair and light indigo eyes with no pupil and a large white highlight at the top of her iris.\nThe Divine Priestess and supreme leader of Watatsumi Island [sic]\nMany believe Sangonomiya Kokomi to be an enigmatic, shrewd leader. However, she always has a quiet smile on her face, and while she gets things done in an orderly fashion, she will sometimes do so over laughter and light conversation.\nHaving read many military treatises from all over Teyvat since she was a child, Kokomi has a talent for strategy and is capable of outwitting opponents through clever stratagems. Although Watatsumi Island lacks manpower and materiel, its people have managed to turn the tide of battle many times thanks to Kokomi's tactical prowess. Whether in battle, trade, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Kokomi will do her best. Her achievements have won her the respect of Watatsumi Island's various factions.\n\"Never fear, Her Excellency Sangonomiya is here,\" has become a popular saying amongst the people of Watatsumi Island.\nHowever, few people know that Kokomi's biggest aspiration has always been to merely be an adviser behind the scenes. Socializing with others is in fact a most tiring task for her. Her hands shake every time she gives a speech, and she entertains thoughts of retreating into herself every time work starts piling up. She enjoys herself most while holed up at home after finishing her work, face buried in her military strategy books.\nTo reach a lofty post at such a young age is considered a great achievement, but for Kokomi, the higher up one is on the mountain, the more treacherous the path.\nThe Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.\nAll of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.\nThe desire to protect Watatsumi Island lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan. The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess. The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.\nThe inhabitants of Watatsumi Island once lived in Enkanomiya, at the bottom of the sea.\nIt was only by the grace of the god Orobaxi bringing them up to the surface that the civilization of Watatsumi Island exists today.\nWhen Orobaxi was slain by the Electro Archon, its body was left as a skeleton and its resentment permeated the land, giving rise to Tatarigami.\nYet its desire to protect Watatsumi Island never faded. This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.\nThe current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.\nThe meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Her height is something she's deeply unsatisfied with, believing that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller.[2] In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.\nWhile she is particularly renowned for her apparent laziness, the members of the Shuumatsuban know that she is loyal to their cause as she would never go against their principles[3] and wouldn't slack off on extremely important matters. Ayaka believes that Sayu's laziness came from her sensei's abrupt departure, as she looked up to them and when they left, became lost and confused.\nOf course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called \"laziness\" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller.[1] She does not like it when people pat her head, believing that doing so impedes her growth. She tolerates headpats from both the Traveler and Yae Miko, although the latter is out of fear of retaliation by the Guuji.\nWhile a particularly skilled ninja, Sayu usually handles reconnaissance and other miscellaneous tasks. While she is trained in combat, the arts she learned were mostly intended for stealth and evasion. She appreciates the Traveler's company, willing to work harder for their sake.[4] While dressed as a mujina, who she finds extremely adorable, Sayu becomes angered whenever people call her a tanuki, even going as far as to attack them.[5]\nSayu uses the short female model and is said to be pint-sized.[6] She has short beige hair and reddish eyes.\nA pint-sized, agile ninja associated with the Shiyuumatsu-Ban.\nHeight has never been one of Sayu's strengths...

She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.\nPeople who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.\nHowever, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, \"It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Originally part of the Tianheng Thaumaturges clan of exorcists, Shenhe originally had a happy life as a child until around the age of six, when her maddened father attempted to sacrifice her to a malevolent god in order to bring back his wife. While Shenhe managed to defeat the remnants of the god herself, the incident scarred her for life, giving her homicidal tendencies and causing her to believe herself to be a \"cursed\" child. Despite the adepti's attempts to contain her tendencies, they have only done so by binding her soul with Red Ropes, which suppress her emotions and cause her to have an indifferent personality. She would live under Cloud Retainer's care for over ten years.[2]\nEven with the red ropes suppressing her homicidal tendencies, Shenhe often contemplates the most violent means to eliminate others and is almost always easy to anger, obliterating her surroundings whenever her emotions get the best of her.[3] She throws hostile looks at Xingqiu, believing him to be threatening others.[4] Despite this, Shenhe ultimately wishes to fit in human society and places great trust in the Traveler.[5][6] She prefers speaking with a small number of people at a time.\nAs a result of living with the adepti, many humans have mistaken her to be one herself and worthy of worship, something which deeply troubles her despite stating that she is just an adepti's disciple. She enjoys sampling small quantities of foods in a manner similar to Albedo. Due to having a limited diet in the mountains, Shenhe is used to eating plenty of herbs despite clearly despising their taste. After moving to Liyue Harbor, one of the aspects she cherishes of civilization is having a wide variety of food to choose from.\nShenhe uses the tall female model. She has a fair complexion, long hair that turns from silvery white at the roots to inky black at the ends, and pale, iridescent eyes with white pupils. She has her nails painted with light blue nail polish.\nShenhe comes from a branch family of a clan of exorcists. Due to certain reasons, Cloud Retainer took her in as a disciple.\nTo Shenhe, Cloud Retainer is a knowledgeable and chatty master.\nTo Cloud Retainer, Shenhe stands out as special from amongst the mortals she has instructed.\nLiving with adepti as a human is by no means an easy task, but Shenhe has a unique constitution, an immensely strong will, and a great talent for adepti arts, all of which have won her the acknowledgment of the adepti. However, the long years of cultivation, coupled with the habit of eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains, have made her more and more distant from earthly life, and she has even been regarded as a mysterious white-haired adeptus.\nThe occasional sharpness in her personality and the red ropes adorning her body add to her \"mystery\". If her past were to be written as a story, there would be multiple versions for sure.\nBe it an immortal or a white-haired witch, how will people view this mysterious lady? Her secrets and feelings are as difficult to capture as the drifting clouds in the mountains.\nShenhe was originally from a branch family of exorcists, but due to a series of coincidences, she became the disciple of an adeptus.\nShe is a student solely of Cloud Retainer in name, but her impressive constitution and intelligence quickly won several other adepti over.\nShe would go on to learn from them all, eventually becoming a master of adeptal arts in her own right as a mortal.\nShe very much looks the part as well in her unique temperament and manner of carrying herself — indeed, it would be no understatement to name her a true adeptus upon meeting her for the first time.\nHowever, it is precisely due to the long years of tutelage that she has lacked company save for the adepti and odd passing illuminated beast.\nThis isolation has caused her to grow distant and indifferent.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Here, Heizou would simply reply with his signature smile: \"I don't know, maybe this is something that even the gods can't do!\"\nShikanoin Heizou is an extraordinary young detective.\nThough working at the Tenryou Commission, he is at odds with the usual impression of a public servant, who is expected to be \"stern,\" \"solemn\"... and \"solemn\" again.\nOn the outside, he appears more well-behaved and polite than any other new hires, but on the inside, he is actually thumbing his nose at all the official mumbo jumbo.\nUnlike his colleagues, he does not go to the Station to report for duty on a daily basis and rarely shows up for any routine patrols.\nIt can seem like ages since you last saw him, and you may finally chance upon him at some crime scene. Yet, judging by that ever-present grin, you can hardly tell if he is actually there working.\nFunnily enough, all his \"unorthodox behaviors as a public servant\" are somewhat acquiesced to.\nHis colleagues are more than willing to work with him and his boss seldom criticizes him for being this unfettered.\nEven his boss's boss inquires after him every now and then.\nAll this can be safely chalked up to his unrivaled prowess as a detective.\nWhenever the Tenryou Commission is tackling an unusually complicated case, be it a major one or a mysterious one, everyone regards Heizou as their last hope to crack the code.\nEven the head of the Police Station marvels at his extensive experience in solving cases, but Heizou himself has a different opinion about that.\n\"Experience is another name for people's past mistakes, and that's not my trump card.\"\n\"My trump card is something I was born with.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Sucrose loves experimenting and spends most of her time researching on bio-alchemy, stating that she likes to discover the secrets of life. Her research often yields numerous results that she often labels every unique variable as a result of its own, regardless of how useful said result may be. She spends an immense amount of time researching that she finds herself quickly bored whenever she takes a break.\nDue to spending most of her time researching and experimenting, Sucrose is a recluse. She has trouble talking with others, as she frequently worries about unintentionally offending them. Lisa remarks that she is hopeless when talking to people,[2] as she is very timid and easily frightened, especially by people of imposing status, such as Jean and Eula.[3] However, she does not share the same issue when talking about bio-alchemy or Albedo. She reveres Albedo to the point that she considers him to be a true gentleman and maintains an excessively formal manner towards him, despite both being of similar age.[4]\nDespite her meek nature, Sucrose is also compassionate and humble. In spite of her social anxiety, she sympathizes very well with those who are equally or even more shy and awkward than herself. She's also supportive of other people's academic pursuits, as shown by her support for Collei's studies and Klee's Jumpy Dumpty creations.[5][6] She's also close to her fellow alchemists Timaeus and Albedo, supporting and respecting them in research and other aspects of their lives. However, she will not shy away from honest criticism of her friends, such as Timaeus' research or Albedo's bad habits, even if doing so scares her.\nSucrose uses the medium female model. She has fair skin, amber eyes, and light green hair that is chin-length except for a section at the back of her head that goes down to her hips. She wears a pair of dark brown round spectacles. Sucrose also has pointed light green animal ears which she tries to hide with her hair; the animal they correspond to is unknown and it is the subject of some of Sucrose's investigations.\nSucrose may be the assistant of the genius alchemist Albedo, but they could not be more different in research direction.\nAs opposed to studying the essence of alchemy and the ability to create new life, she is far more interested in using alchemy to modify existing life, all the better to add variety and color to this world.\nDespite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.\nEven people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.\nHowever, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this.\nIt's a secret, and is also her little dream.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Tartaglia describes himself as \"kind of a bad guy\", living for the thrill of a fight and causing chaos. As a child, Tartaglia was frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an adventurer like the ones his father told him about as they fished together. After falling into The Abyss and meeting and training with Skirk, Tartaglia's personality drastically changed. Although he appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a bloodthirsty warrior. The Abyss and his old master, Skirk, made him self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power. Tartaglia considers those who wish to become strong like him to be friends and takes pleasure in battling them on the battlefield. He lusts for combat and grows excited by fighting strong opponents, even if it could mean dying in the process. He uses bows because he is weakest with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating.[2]\nBecause of his pride, Tartaglia is exceptionally reliable at accomplishing the tasks given to him, no matter how difficult they may be or if they go against his values. This, combined with his straightforward nature, makes him rather easy to manipulate. Despite disliking how his plan in Liyue Harbor could potentially harm innocents, he puts it into motion to fulfill his mission in Liyue — only to learn he was meant to fail as part of an even larger plan he was not privy to, much to his consternation.\nAmongst the rest of the Harbingers, Tartaglia is considered an oddball, but also the least corrupt. While his fellow Harbingers prefer clandestine operations and staying behind the scenes, Tartaglia favors being front and center. He is a public figure known for attending social gatherings and even participates as an actor in plays and theater. As a result, Childe's coworkers are wary of him, while he holds them in disdain for their schemes and \"intangible\" methods. While he is easily capable of scheming, he only resorts to such approaches when necessary due to his straightforward nature. He also appears to treat his subordinates less harshly than the rest of the Harbingers, stating that he doesn't use lethal force against the recruits in his care nor does he threaten any of them.\nTartaglia dedicates himself to those he cares about wholeheartedly. He is unquestionably loyal to the Tsaritsa and holds her in high esteem, seeing himself as her weapon of war.[3] He also cares deeply for his family; he sends money, gifts, and letters home often. Tartaglia is exceptionally proud of his three younger siblings and dotes on them frequently, especially his youngest brother Teucer — he is willing to lie and even put himself in mortal danger, so as long as it makes him happy. Although he was once on good terms with Zhongli (even allowing the former Archon to use him as financial support), he seems to have taken his deception personally, stating he will only forgive him if he agrees to trial by combat.[4] Zhongli appears to be unaware of Tartaglia's change in opinion, being under the impression he will still meet him for drinks to catch up after the recent Liyue events.[5]\nTartaglia uses the tall male model. He has short ginger[6] hair and dull blue eyes. He wears a red Fatui mask pulled off to the left side of his head, and a beaded earring with a red crystal on his left ear. A few lighter blond streaks can be seen in his hair, with one prominent one on the left side of his bangs.\nTartaglia wears his Blades of Glory outfit during the first phase of his Golden House battle. After the first phase, Tartaglia's clothes turn from gray to black, he wears his mask on his face, and his Hydro Vision appears to be supplanted by his Electro Delusion. After the second phase, he undergoes a full outfit change and becomes larger, and his Vision reappears in the empty slot on his right chest while his Delusion moves to the center of his belt. Both his Vision and Delusion also obtain more prominent black and silver casings.\nWarm and friendly one minute, ruthless killer the next... His shifting and unpredictable personality can leave those around him at a loss for words to describe him. But in rare, private moments, he dispenses with titles, casts off his armor and the layers of intrigue that come with it, and show his authentic self.\nHis name is Tartaglia, and he is devoted to the thrill and the physical feel of battle.\nDon't be under any illusion as to what he might be thinking or what his intentions are. Just remember this: Behind that innocent, childlike exterior lies a finely honed instrument of war.\nLike a velvet sheath that houses an ostensibly ornamental blade, his unpredictability puts people on edge.\nDespite holding one of the most senior positions in the Fatui as one of the Eleven Harbingers, Childe very much looks like the young adult that he still is.\nHe is a wolf in sheep's clothing, however, for under the cheerful and confident appearance lies a deadly swordsman.\nHe is the youngest among the Harbingers, but one of the most dangerous among their number.\nThat said, Childe doesn't seem to fit in well with the others.\nAs a fighter first and foremost, he is quite at odds with this organization of deceit and treachery.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Being a Forest Watcher, Tighnari is highly knowledgeable about various species of both plants and animals, particularly flowers and mushrooms, having grown an interest due to studying his parents' books when he was young. He spends a great deal of time in Sumeru's rainforests, studying various species of plants and ensuring that the ecosystem is healthy and balanced. As the Chief Officer of the Forest Watchers, he takes his job very seriously and offers advice to those willing to listen and sternly lectures those who don't. He is very loyal to those whom he considers his friends and cares about them very deeply.\nDue to his Valuka Shuna heritage, Tighnari is particularly sensitive to weather, disliking the wind and thunder. While his kind used to live in the desert, Tighnari, having a darker shade of fur (which he attributes to his kind migrating to the forests), is notably unable to tolerate the desert heat, causing him to suffer from heatstroke faster than others. He acknowledges this as one of his weaknesses.\nHe serves as a mentor to Collei, who in turn sees him as a Master of some sorts and holds him with high regard. He places a lot of value on knowledge, and thus oversees her education seriously, ensuring that she understands the content to the best of her ability. While he is friends with Cyno, he does not appreciate his jokes, having been exposed to many unfunny jokes and considers them embarrassing.\nTighnari uses the medium male model. He has fair skin, chin-length dark green hair with black roots and light green streaks at the front, and pale-pupiled eyes that fade from brown to green. He also possesses large, pointy black ears and a fluffy tail in two shades of dark green.\nPeople who encounter misfortunes in the Avidya Forest are lucky to meet a Forest Watcher named Tighnari.\nBut if you land yourself in trouble due to foolish antics, you might have mixed feelings meeting Tighnari.\nTighnari resolves problems quickly and professionally, but at the same time, he will give the other party a stern lecture.\nAs the saying goes, those who underestimate the rainforest will get taught a lesson by it, and those who underestimate a Forest Watcher will eventually face the teachings of the \"Wilderness Survival Skills Lecture.\"\nThese are all rumors, but in reality, there is no need to be too stressed when encountering Tighnari. Anyone with a clear head will be able to comprehend his easy-to-understand explanations.\nAs for those who are set in their ways—\n\"What a pity, I majored in botany, and helping people grow a brain is not my area of expertise.\"\nThose who travel through Avidya Forest will sometimes meet a rather special Forest Watcher.\nHe has large ears, a long tail, and a slightly delicate face. If a less discerning eye were to appraise him, he might even look like some kind of small, rare animal native to the forests.\nBut anyone who has even been acquainted with him will know that there is clarity to his words and steadiness in his bearing.\n\"One moment, please. Judging from your equipment, you're a traveling merchant bound for Sumeru City, aren't you? Come back, please, you're going the wrong way.\"\n\"I mean, just look over there. The leaves are dense and the air grows damper. That doesn't seem like the main road leading to the city, no matter how you slice it.\"\n\"Oh dear, your waterskin is empty, isn't it?\"\n\"Come, let me share some with you.

In the opening cutscene, twin siblings from another world travel through the universe, until an unknown god blocks their path. The player gets to choose either Aether (male) or Lumine (female) as the traveler and the Traveler's Sibling becomes captured.\nTheir power to travel is sealed, leaving them stranded on Teyvat. They save Paimon by fishing her out of the water and she accompanies them as their new travel companion. Together they set out on a journey to find The Seven and reunite with the Traveler's lost sibling.\nAlthough players can choose the name they want to be referred by, the Traveler's Sibling refers to the Traveler by their real name, regardless of their custom name. In Natlan, the Traveler also gains the Ancient Name TMN (\"TMN,\" Tumaini).\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nAt the beginning of the game and in The Crux Clash in Chapter II: Prologue - Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves, the Traveler is \"unaligned,\" a special elemental state exclusive to them. When unaligned, the color of the Traveler's \"vision\" and background when they are selected in the Character Menu is gray. Although the Traveler's Profile lists their Constellation properly as Viator/Viatrix, attempting to open the Constellation tab will show a blank screen with \"Constellation Unavailable\" in the bottom-right corner. When unaligned, the Traveler has only one talent, Normal Attack: Past Memories.\nWhen unaligned, screens that show character cards with their elements show a gray \"no\" symbol (🚫︎) in the place of the element symbol.\nShortly after the beginning of the game, the Traveler will unlock their Anemo Talents and Constellation by resonating with the first Statue of The Seven in Mondstadt. They can resonate with any other Statue of The Seven they find and change their element to match the statue's element. See Teyvat for each region's element.\nHowever, the Traveler does not gain the Pyro element upon resonating with a Statue of The Seven in Natlan, due to corrupted Ley Lines in the region. They instead unlock their abilities during Where All Hopes Lie in Chapter V: Act V - Incandescent Ode of Resurrection.\nThe Traveler is obtained at the start of the game and is not featured in any Wishes.",
    "lore": "The Traveler's personality is determined primarily by the player themselves through dialogue options.\nTheir personality can range from stoic, humble and helpful to boastful, lazy, and short-tempered. Regardless of the player's in-game decisions, they are generally liked by the playable characters. There are instances of single speech options or similar options which give a glimpse at their personality overall. They are, for example, observed by Paimon as not believing the gods are any more worthy of unearned respect than mortal inhabitants of Teyvat. They also are pointedly uninterested in getting involved with each nation's troubles and primarily only concern themselves with finding out their sibling's whereabouts. Their response to Morax's \"death\" was initially to simply leave, both to avoid suspicion and seemingly a level of apathy considering the circumstances of their arrival on the world.\nThis trend continues into Inazuma, where the Traveler initially denies aid to the rebellion and refuses to take sides, interested only in meeting with the Raiden Shogun. The Traveler is visibly frustrated, not wanting to meddle in the country's affairs or get involved with anyone, even for a task as simple as delivering a letter. Yet despite this hesitation to get involved, they are ultimately a compassionate person, eventually choosing to aid the resistance against the Shogun's injustice after seeing the circumstances of each situation particularly at the prodding of Kamisato Ayaka and Thoma. Later on in Sumeru, they later help free Lesser Lord Kusanali from the sages of the Sumeru Akademiya after learning of her plight. Despite their slight indifference to Teyvat's conflicts, they greatly cherish every bond they create with the people. Arlecchino also believes that the Traveler is incapable of performing intentionally malevolent acts.[1]\nThe Traveler does not appear to be very talkative, with several characters noting that they are not very fond of speaking or starting conversations. Though Shikanoin Heizou once joked about Paimon serving as the Traveler's \"voice,\" the Traveler does indeed prefer having Paimon speak on their behalf.\nDue to their experiences with the Fatui and the Abyss Order, the Traveler is immediately on guard at the mere mention of them. The Traveler is shown to be friendly to a degree to those that respect them, such as Tartaglia and Enjou. Although initially friendly with Lyney and Lynette, their friendship was damaged after they failed to inform the Traveler that they were Fatui operatives from the House of the Hearth (as they knew of their interactions with them). Eventually, after some apologizing from Lyney, the Traveler reconciles with them, and subsequently maintains a good relationship with Arlecchino and the House.\nThey also show significant concern for their sibling, as their initial goal was to find them and get answers from the Unknown God that sealed them away. Upon reuniting with their sibling, the Traveler was more concerned with returning home with their sibling as opposed to their role as the Abyss Order's leader or their war with the Heavenly Principles. Despite their position with the Abyss, they still miss them dearly, and continue to follow their instructions in seeing the world for themselves.\nAether uses the medium male model, and Lumine uses the medium female model. Both siblings have (‍blondblondText for male Traveler/blondeblondeText for female Traveler‍) hair, fiery-gold eyes, and pale skin. During their fight with the unknown god, both siblings had yellow wings.\nAether's hair is a more saturated color and very long, while Lumine's hair is paler and chin-length except for two locks of shoulder-length hair framing her face. Lumine also has two light-blue Inteyvat flowers pinned on the right of her head and two pale blue feathers tucked at the left.\nThe keeper is fading away; the creator has not yet come.\nBut the world shall burn no more, for you shall ascend.\nA boy and a girl stood amidst the tumult, under an unfamiliar sky.\nYou were a pair of traveling twins, passing through countless worlds during your journey.\nDescending upon a continent named Teyvat, you hoped that you would be able to enjoy your time here.\nBut as you awoke among the falling stars, you saw the world in turmoil, a cataclysm raging across the land...\nYou sought to leave this place and move on to the next world, but then an unknown god stood before you, barring the way.\nThis deity was spotless, floating over a world of chaos.\nLooking down on you.\nThe god took your only kin away, and you were sealed and cast into a deep slumber filled with nightmares...\nWhen you reawakened, the world was changed.\nThe flames of war raged no longer, and nothing was left that looked familiar.\nHow long had you been asleep? You had no answers.\nThus, you began a lonely journey, seeking the deity that you had once laid eyes upon...\nSong of the Dragon and Freedom"

    "lore": "Venti has a somewhat recalcitrant, carefree, and playful attitude as well as a liking to rhyming in his speech. He sees a particular worth in music to the point where he names his lyre, saying, \"every being deserves a name to be called upon, and woven into a song.\" He is also bold, not fearing to insult or ignore those who are supposedly powerful. In the game, he responds to Paimon's comments and nicknaming by parroting her.\nVenti enjoys roaming around Mondstadt playing songs to his people, most of whom are unaware of his true identity as Barbatos. He is very well-liked due to his musical talent, having won the title \"Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt\" three times.[2] He is also an avid drinker of alcoholic beverages, such as Dandelion Wine and has an unusually high tolerance to alcohol. He is also fine with apple cider. To his disdain, the form he takes causes most bartenders to see him as a minor.\nBeing a god who is generally absent for prolonged periods of time, Venti has no personal finances; he often resorts to pilfering from the Dawn Winery for food and shamelessly has people listening to his songs buy him drinks in lieu of a payment. For reasons unknown, he is deathly allergic to cats and will not perform unless he is certain none are nearby.\nHe also enjoys apples, considering them to be the fruit of the gods, jokingly stating that he would refuse to go to Celestia even if he was invited because their apples are bland and the water foul, which would make bad cider. He dislikes items that are sticky and slimy, such as cheese.\nDespite his normally playful personality as the bard Venti, he speaks wisely and somewhat philosophically whenever he assumes his true identity due to the many experiences he had being one of the original members of The Seven. Compared to Zhongli, the mortal vessel of Morax, Venti does not mind revealing his identity and using his powers for various tasks.\nFor all his cheer and wisdom, Venti hides a lonely soul who, even millennia later, continues to feel strongly about the loss of the Bard whose form he imitates and even compares himself to \"Stanley\" for he too assumed the appearance of his deceased friend, and tells the Traveler that it is in the most innoccous moments are those in which he suddenly is hit by his grief.\nVenti also confesses to finding the Traveler's ability to discern what he's thinking as discomforting, but admits that he appreciates having a true friend, similar to how he views the Bard.\nVenti uses the medium male model. He has fair skin, aqua green eyes, and short black-ish blue hair with short twin braids at the sides of his face that fade into aqua blue. The tips glow in Anemo-aqua color when he uses his Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst.\nHis form is modeled after the Nameless Bard, a friend who perished in the rebellion to liberate Decarabian's Mondstadt from Decarabian's rule 2600 years ago. In addition to using this form as an ordinary Mondstadter, he also uses it when appearing as an Archon, as seen in his Statues of The Seven, the Anemo Archon Statue in front of the Favonius Cathedral, and the manga.\nThe \"Vision\" on his hip behaves like other characters' Visions in most gameplay; however, in reality, it is only \"a glass ball [he carries] around to avoid suspicion,\"[3] and there are a select few gameplay mechanics that reflect this. His Vision can also be seen turning into \"Der Frühling,\" a wooden lyre with Cecilias and blue strings imbued with the power of Anemo.\n▌Singer of Skyward Sonnets · Venti\nA bard as free as the wind, now residing in the city of dandelions.\n===============================\n\"I sing to you now of the beauty of all things, seasons come and seasons go, yet the four winds keep their wings.\nThough the credit is mine, for from my lyre rings, A story that would run cold, were it not for my strings!\"\n—Venti's singing, from when he becomes inebriated.\nAn unknown bard that came from nowhere. He sometimes sings outdated songs, other times he hums new ones that none have ever heard of.\nHe likes apples and lively atmospheres, but hates cheese and anything that is slimy.\nWhen channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of feathers, because he likes things that look light.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Before the \"three betrayals\" which changed him and before regaining his memories, the Wanderer is amicable and curious about the world. Right after his creation, he was full of hope and curiosity, yet also sensitive enough to the cruelties of the world that they embittered his personality after long enough. When the Traveler discovers him wandering Sumeru, he is still pleasant, but haunted by a lack of purpose and, similarly to his younger years, worried about fitting in with humanity due to his lacking a human heart. He also expresses a desire to understand what he has done in the past and reclaim that part of himself. After remembering his past and seeing the truth behind his second betrayal, he takes on a personality similar to his previous incarnation, Scaramouche - having a misanthropic worldview and unpleasant personality. He treats everyone around him with contempt and tends to be arrogant due to his divine nature, often acting rude and abrasive.\nWhile Nahida tries her best to help the Wanderer see the more positive sides of humanity, he is still rather cynical of humanity and likens his relationship to her as simply paying off his \"debts\" to her, despite her insistence otherwise. The Traveler still maintains some degree of caution towards him due to his unpredictable nature and former conflicts with him, which he often pokes fun at. He is fond of bitter tastes and despises sweets.\nThe Wanderer uses the medium male model. He has blue eyes framed with red eyeliner, fair skin, and short midnight blue hair in ear-length, with choppy bangs falling over his eyes.\nOn a fateful night, a figure arrived at a place that had once been called Tatarasuna. There should no longer have been residents there, but as if destiny had decreed it, a farmer had come there, picking Naku Weed to make a living. Thus it was under the moonlight that he saw a phantom figure standing on the edge of the cliff.\nThis person wore a wide hat that concealed their face entirely. However, the farmer could hear breathing through the pitter-patter of the rain.\nA moment later, the figure spoke. \"This is how humans should breathe.\"\nThe farmer was terrified that he might had encountered some spirit, and hurriedly hid behind a rock. The figure spoke again. \"What are you afraid of? Would a passerby such as I hurt you? I am merely here to tend to the grave of a friend.\"\nSilence filled the air once more. The farmer peeked out from behind the rock, and saw that the figure had vanished. A note drifted to the ground and was instantly soaked by the rain. Three questions had been written on that piece of paper, along with answers that were not yet fully written—\nIf humans have a heart, why do they not fear the hearts of others?\nDue to their inferior nature.\nHow should one treat others, knowing full well their inferiority?\n...\nHow can one be a human being without a heart?\nOne without a heart is hardly human.\nChills ran down the farmer's spine as he finished reading the note. Tatarasuna had been deserted for many years, and it had been a long time since anyone came here to pay their respects. And even if there were, why would they appear on such a night?\nHe needs not introduce himself, for ordinary folk will never get to know him.\nNor will he need to immerse himself in the sea of humanity, for he has long forsaken any worthless emotion.\nSeveral times now he has risen and fallen, and now he lives only for himself.\n\"Wanderer\" is how he believes he might be best described — he has no home, no kin, and no destination.\nLike the breeze, he lives in this world, and he walks its length and breadth.\nFriendship Lv. 2  •  Inversion of Genesis"

    "lore": "Wriothesley is the \"Duke\" of the Fortress of Meropide, serving as the prison's administrator and overseeing the facility's overall status. Despite his appearance, Wriothesley is fairly calm and collected, not worrying too much about the prison's infamous reputation as he only sees himself as a \"leader\" of sorts to oversee the population and ensure they have the \"tranquility\" they desire. He sees the prison as a place of rebirth and is willing to protect that way of life, not wanting others to suffer like he once did, and becomes extremely angered should such a circumstance occur on his watch. His relaxed policies has made him very popular among many inmates, who tend to address him as if he was nobility, due to being bestowed the title of \"Duke\" by the Palais Mermonia.\nWhile he owns a pair of mechanical gauntlets for use in fighting, he is not an advocate for violence, not wanting to get more blood on his hands. However, he is willing to kill others should he have no choice, to maintain law and order.\nOutside of his duties, he enjoys drinking tea.\nWriothesley uses the tall male model. He has tufted black hair with grey streaks, pale grey eyes, and pale skin. He bears a scar beneath his right eye; three scars extending from high on his neck down to his mid-chest, with one on the right, one on the left, and one along the midline; and scars on his left and right forearms.\n\"Administrator of the Fortress of Meropide\"\n— If Wriothesley needed a namecard, this would suffice.\nNo foreword, and no epilogue. Just like that place of exiled convicts he's in charge of, standing there silently at the bottom of the sea.\nDespite its discretion, as a resting place for criminals, the Fortress of Meropide harbors a network of conflicting interests that would have a corrupting influence on many.\nBut even if someone was bent on infiltrating this place, they'd soon be swallowed up like breadcrumbs in a bowl of soup.\nSome have lauded His Grace's aptitude for taking care of thorny problems. Hearing such praise, Wriothesley would simply lower his teacup... and pick up his newspaper.\n\"You've got the wrong end of the stick. They just wanted somewhere to lead well-ordered lives, and I gave them the 'tranquility' they required.\"\nTo the great relief of the Maison Ordalie, most Fontainians are law-abiding citizens. As such, the Fortress of Meropide is not a place that they will ever visit in their lives.\nAt the same time, there is an easily understood yet rather tragic truth, which is that those who have served time often find it difficult to reintegrate back into the \"overworld,\" and few will actively speak of their experiences in the \"underworld.\"\nRather than a specific place, the Fortress is more like an idea, a warning, a symbol of misfortune and castigation — a byword amongst Fontainians. As for who controls this idea, that is unimportant.\nThanks to this state of affairs, Wriothesley has been able to lead a secluded and private existence, living and traveling in Fontaine in a manner quite unbefitting of his status as the \"Duke.\"\nIndeed, even as pedestrians are saying things like \"fool around any further, and I'll punch you straight into the Fortress of Meropide,\" or \"this job is garbage, I'd rather be tightening screws at the bottom of the sea,\" this administrator of said underwater fortress might be walking the same stone-paved road to the café, on his way to grab some takeout for his afternoon tea.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Xiangling loves cooking, having learned the art from her father. She does not have a discerning eye towards a specific type of cuisine, seeing that food is a way to expand and experiment. She will use anything for her recipes, even unconventional ingredients that would gross out others. Some of the bizarre ingredients that Xiangling uses are slimes and lizards.[2] Even if some of the dishes are not to her liking, Xiangling will not give up and simply press on to modify or start over from scratch.\nHer unconventional cooking is what led her to acclaim in both Mondstadt and Liyue. Unlike most cooks, Xiangling is not concerned about mora, stating that food is to nourish and that the smiles on her customers' faces is more than enough for her. She dislikes having to limit herself to a specific style of cooking, seeing it as bland and unsurprising. Likewise, she prefers hands-on cooking, believing that automated cooking is inauthentic.[3]\nOutside of cooking, Xiangling is easy to scare and is often pranked by Hu Tao.[4] Despite disliking her pranks, Xiangling does not have a grudge towards her because she occasionally brings her gifts in return for giving her a good laugh.[5]\nXiangling uses the medium female model. She has navy blue hair cut in a bob-like fashion at the front and of unknown length at the back, golden eyes, and a pale complexion.\nLiyue is home to two rival culinary traditions, conveniently named the \"Li\" and \"Yue\" styles. Foodies in Liyue are staunch supporters of one style or the other, and have long been embroiled in a bitter battle to prove the superiority of their style.\nIn this war waged by culinary snobs, ostentation is everything, flavor gets forgotten, and nothing is a simple matter of taste. Much to the consternation of Liyue's chefs, the Li vs. Yue debate eats up all of the region's rare cooking ingredients in the pursuit of ever-more-pretentious dishes.\nBorn into a restaurateur family, Xiangling inherited her fair share of this consternation. But she also chose to inherit the Wanmin Restaurant and become one of the few to push back against the status quo.\n\"Good food is good food, period!\" Xiangling's mantra is an antidote to snobbery as she sets about creating her imaginative and unconventional dishes.\nFrom a pinch of Mist Flower and a drop of Slime Condensate to a handful of unidentified flying insects and even hilichurls' wooden clubs, Xiangling is known to be somewhat adventurous with her choice of cooking ingredients.\nNaturally, her unique approach leads to the occasional disastrous dish. But Xiangling never gives up, because of what her father has always said to her: \"There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion.\"\n\"Coming, coming! Here's your Stir-Fried Filet! And your Mora Meat. And Fried Radish Balls, as you ordered.\"\nIn Liyue, there's a place called Chihu Rock, and there stands a restaurant known as Wanmin Restaurant.\nOne must remain focused if they want to keep moving forward on the bustling streets of Liyue.\nUnsuspecting newcomers to this place are often lured away by wonderful culinary aromas or lead to peek inside stores by curious sounds.\nXiangling, who is both chef and waitress at the restaurant, delivers steaming, delicious dishes to the tables.\n\"Sit anywhere you'd like. I can make whatever you want, even if it's not on the menu!\"\nThe workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first sentence out of their mouths.\nA customer that orders without needing a menu has been at least a few times before. However, if they ask \"Is Xiangling the chef today?\" then they're definitely a regular.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "As an adeptus, Xianyun is devoted to protecting Liyue from external threats and sees Morax in high regard; when she learned of his apparent demise, she flew into a fury and threatened to destroy Liyue Harbor for their crimes, only for the Traveler to placate her by reminding her of her duties. She also has a habit of speaking formally, often addressing herself as \"one\". In the past, she was revered as a decisive and bold figure, while she was also known by her fellow adepti as solemn and taciturn, rarely speaking outside of activating sigils during battle.\nHaving lived for thousands of years, Xianyun was good friends with Guizhong and shared a similar like of mechanics; following her death in the Archon War, she modified the Guizhong Ballista to honor her memory. She is competitive and prideful, generally starting competitions over fairly trivial matters, such as cooking and racing. She also shows a caring side to her disciples; she made a special pinwheel device for Ganyu after noticing she was interested in some being sold at a stall, and was pleased to see her enjoy it. When she is with Ganyu, she generally has a habit of reminiscing about her past, much to Ganyu's embarrassment. Likewise, she was curious about how Shenhe was doing in human society and was pleased to see she had no issues.\nXianyun uses the tall female model. She has fair skin and navy hair that has light blue undertones. Her hair is tied in a high ponytail secured with a hairpin that resembles the sharpness of a crane. She has shorter eyebrows and wears red glasses. Although Xianyun seems to take the form of a human, she has taloned fingers, like the claws of a crane.\nIn her crane form, she is taller than many humans and is white with blue, gold, and black plumage. Under her eyes are red markings.\nEveryone has something to say about Xianyun: \"That tall woman with the updone hair,\" \"that bespectacled artisan,\" or perhaps \"that talkative new neighbor.\" They all say different things, but together they paint a picture of the impression she leaves — of someone who's witty, chatty, warm-hearted, and easy to get along with.\nBut that's not how Xianyun sees herself. In her own eyes, she's inarticulate, reserved, and unyieldingly proud. Aside from her mastery of mechanics and knack for making all kinds of little trinkets, it's an entirely different image from how others would describe her.\nSome curious individuals, seeing how her mannerisms and bearing set her apart from ordinary folk, are convinced that she's a heroine — so they go around trying to uncover her heroic backstory and whether she goes by any other names.\nAsk the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant, and with a wave of his hand, he'd say: \"Xianyun? We're not well acquainted, but going by her name, she sounds like a good person.\"\nAsk Madame Ping from Yujing Terrace, and she'd nod and reply: \"Xian... Oh, Xianyun? We've crossed paths, yes... She's a good person, you know. Once you've met, you'll find that your days seem to go by much more smoothly.\"\nAsk Ganyu, and she'd nod too: \"She is a heroine, but a very discreet one — hence why she's living incognito in Liyue Harbor.\"\nAsk Shenhe, and she'd respond pensively: \"Xianyun... Of course, she's a master. Whatever you do, you must not offend her.\"\nAs it turns out, such speculations are not wrong. There's far more to Xianyun than meets the eye, but those who know the full story are few indeed. If someone was to address her as \"Cloud Retainer\"... Well, people would know her instantly, and you'd hear a torrent of praise flow her way: \"Who doesn't know Cloud Retainer? Noble, brave, loyal, and wise... A most worthy friend if ever there was one!\"\nSo try asking Xianyun herself then: \"Are you a heroine? Surely you're not... an adeptus?\"\nYou catch the new resident just as she's working on her latest invention, her pride and joy — what she calls an \"Exquisite Mini Broth Pot.\" She's too absorbed to take the question seriously, so she simply waves it off as a load of old nonsense and tells you not to bother her while she's busy.\nAs for what exactly an Exquisite Mini Broth Pot is... No one really knows, other than having been told that it brings out flavors much better than a regular soup pot. Likewise, none would know how profoundly it might impact Liyue Harbor's future gastronomic development. Suffice to say — if Xianyun says it'll be impressive, it'll be impressive alright.\nAccording to the \"Thrice Annotated Version of the Full Record of Pristine Pavilion,\" a roaming adeptus travels with the \"Spirit of Eight Pure and Mighty Rose-Clouds,\" dancing through the air as though \"riding light and striding lightning.\" Their lives, too, are long beyond mortal reckoning. What humans call a millennium is but time for a short rest for the adeptus in their abode. As the saying goes, \"Night and day belong not in paradise.\"\nAs for where the adepti dwell, the \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\" asserts that the sky is their pillow and the earth their mat, and that they may dwell in the mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas — and this indeed seems to explain the countless adeptal encounters recorded in the annals of Liyue's history. This is one school of thought.\nAnother can be found in the classic treatise on metal and stone, \"Void-Pacing Stone Catalog.\" While showering praise upon the weird and wonderful rock formations of Jueyun Karst, \"Stone Catalog\" also proffers a warning: \"The peaks of Jueyun tower up to lofty heights, striving to outdo one another... each belonging to a different master — Qingyun Peak to Moon Carver, Mt. Hulao to Mountain Shaper, Mt. Aocang to Cloud Retainer. The wise climb not a mastered mountain, nor quarry its rocks.\"\nOut of a similar veneration, descriptions of what the adepti actually look like are few and far between. Based on a handful of allusions to Cloud Retainer's appearance in the historian Zichang's \"Stone Tablet Compilations,\" as well as scattered references in ancient songs, we can know that the adepti are ever-changing in form. To take Cloud Retainer as an example, when in human form, she is said to be \"of elegant countenance, dressed in purpled robes and made up like a flower in full bloom\"; whereas in bestial form, she \"flies with grace, soaring among the clouds and crying out to the moon.\"\nInterestingly, one particular tale recounted in \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\" gives a further idea of the sublime character of the adepti. Once upon a time, a traveler happened upon Cloud Retainer while passing through Jueyun Karst. Taking out a self-made timepiece which he proudly dubbed a \"Jade Bottle Float-Type Water Clock,\" he sought to impress his ingenuity upon the adeptus. But to his surprise, she instead summarily pointed out the flaws of using a float-type water clock to record the passing of time. Hearing this, the traveler begged for her guidance, which he eventually received before being sent back down the mountain.\nSuch tales are apt to make mortals lament — it is only after meeting an adeptus, free and unfettered by the material world, that one can truly realize how insignificant our lives are.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Xiao is a yaksha who has fought in the Archon War and holds a high level of seniority among adepti. He has a reserved demeanor and has little intention of getting close to mortals. He does not want sympathy for his past and believes his fellow Yakshas would also find it insulting.[2]\nHe is immensely grateful to Morax for saving him, dedicating his life to protecting Liyue as payment. He does not take lightly to those who speak ill of the Geo Archon regardless of whoever they are.[3] Despite suffering from constant karmic debt, Xiao is highly resilient towards its alluring corruption, as his fellow yaksha have either succumbed or died to it. Due to this debt, he prefers being alone and rarely involves himself in mortal affairs; in the few times he does have to, he asks they get to the point for their own sake.\nXiao is unfamiliar with many human customs and societal norms, often finding them strange, childish, or pointless. To others, he can come off as distant and intimidating. After meeting the Traveler, he becomes slightly more relaxed, willing to learn customs and visit Liyue Harbor with them for their sake despite his reservations with mortal life.[4][5] He is also revealed to be a strict yet effective teacher when acting as a mentor figure for Ganyu, but he believes that as a soul-slaughtering yaksha, he is not a suitable teacher for her.[6]\nUnlike most of the adepti, Xiao is not particularly fond of most human foods, although he makes exceptions to Almond Tofu and later Grilled Tiger Fish, the former reminding him of the dreams he used to consume and the latter to honor Pervases' memory.\nXiao uses the medium male model. He has dark medium-length hair with teal undertones, pale skin, golden irises with avian pupils, and red eyeshadow. Xiao also has a purple diamond marking on his forehead and a green tattoo around his right arm.\nXiao's illuminated beast form has not been seen yet outside of certain stylized merchandise, but it has been teased in his character design, his constellation, and his yaksha alias Alatus. It is implied that he takes on the form of Garuda, a Hindu demigod, or Peng (a part of his true name in Chinese: 金鹏 Jīnpéng), a creature present in both Chinese and Buddhist mythos. Xiao has been called the 'Golden-Winged King,' which may be another reference to the Golden-Winged Great Peng, a guardian deity in Mahayana Buddhism.\nIn some lines of Genshin Impact merchandise, stylized depictions of Xiao's avian form has been shown. The bird form appears to be a finch-like, though this is inconclusive due to stylization.  Its plumage features multiple shades of teal, reddish eyes and Xiao's purple diamond symbol on its forehead.\nXiao is an illuminated beast who has lived for around four thousand years[Note 1]. In his youth, he was enslaved by an ancient god who learned his weakness and forced to perform cruel, violent acts on the god's behalf, including devouring the dreams of his victims. The god's bloodthirsty path came to an end at Morax's hand during the Archon War; Xiao was freed and Morax bestowed him with the name \"Xiao\" for his own protection. Xiao became deeply loyal to the Geo God as a result, a trait that continues to the present day.\nWhen Morax rallied the yakshas to help him suppress the lingering hatred and grudges of fallen gods, Xiao was among those who responded.[Note 2] Xiao, under the name Alatus, was one of the five foremost Yakshas alongside Bonanus, Bosacius, Indarias, and Menogias.[7] He also fought alongside many other junior yakshas such as Pervases.\nHowever, over the ages, the yakshas' task wore away their numbers: Not only did they have to fight against the lingering power of ancient gods, the hatred that they had to suppress tainted their own souls and mired them in karmic debt, which incurred enormous physical and psychological pain. Between battle casualties, madness, and desertion, the number of yakshas eventually dwindled to Bosacius and Xiao.[7] Bosacius, too, eventually disappeared and left his belongings behind in Minlin,[8] leaving Xiao as the last Yaksha Guardian. Xiao nearly succumbed to his karmic debt himself at one point, but was saved by the music Venti played during one of the Anemo Archon's visits to Liyue.[9]\nWhile Xiao's callous exterior can make him appear intimidating, much of his outward personality stems from his reservations about the violent deeds he has performed[10][11] and the loss of his allies over the course of the years.[12] Deep down, Xiao is a gentle soul who is curious about humanity, but is hesitant to show that side of himself due to his past experiences and his karma-ridden constitution.[13]\nDue to the nature of his work, Xiao typically avoids humans. Not only does he think his bloody past makes him incapable of fitting in,[10] human souls are less robust than adepti's and his karmic debt taints his surroundings.[2] As a result, few people even in Liyue know much about him or his role in protecting Liyue. Those who do know, as well as other adepti, call him the Conqueror of Demons (Chinese: 降魔大圣 Xiángmó Dàshèng, \"Great Sage who Subdues Demons\") out of respect.\nThe Liyue Qixing built the Wangshu Inn at Dihua Marsh, run by their agents Verr Goldet and Huai'an, to give Xiao a place to stay and rest as he carries out his duty. He appears to get along relatively well with the two agents: He entrusted Dusky Ming to them,[14] while they cover for his unintended destructive tendencies[Note 3] and express their concern for him during Lantern Rite.[15]\nIn the Traveler's presence, Xiao is more willing to indulge his curiosity about humanity, even if their ways perplex him, and offers to visit Liyue Harbor with the Traveler for the purposes of bonding and learning.[4][5] With Liyue's citizens beginning to self-govern and other adepti withdrawing their presence, Xiao continues defending Liyue and also makes more attempts to understand the people.\nThe people of Liyue Harbor greatly revere the mighty and illuminated adepti who dwell in Jueyun Karst.\nDuring the festival seasons, they will offer up incense and pray to the adepti for their protection.\nBut none pray to Xiao.\nFor Xiao is no lucky star that promises fame and fortune — he is a demon-hunting Yaksha.\nAfter the lantern lights of Liyue have faded, the thankless battle to protect the city goes on unseen. It is an endless battle, and there can be no victor.\nStill, none of this fazes Xiao, for as the Vigilant Yaksha, he must protect Liyue to honor his contract.\nThis is simply the way it is.\nXiao may have the appearance of a young man, but his true age is something over two thousand years.\nFortunately, people do not tend to underestimate him on the basis of his appearance — one only needs to spend a short time with Xiao to clarify that he is not someone to be trifled with.\nXiao is a man of few words. He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen.\nHe enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown in the mortal realm.\nThis is inevitable. Xiao is not one of those popular deities to whom people pray for wealth and protection, nor is he a mystical sage of Jueyun Karst to whom pilgrims flock in search of divine wisdom.\nNo... If any mortal witnesses Xiao unleashing his true power, it is certain to be under the direst of circumstances — and they will be extremely lucky if they survive the ordeal.\nThis is not because Xiao seeks to harm people. Rather, since Xiao wages a constant war against dark forces powerful enough to devour Liyue in its entirety, any bystanders who witness him in the heat of battle are likely to end up as collateral damage.\nNot that this is a secret worth going around silencing witnesses for.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "To most people, Xingqiu appears to be a polite young man who takes his studies seriously, but he also has a more mischievous side to him. In the presence of close friends and family, he is gregarious and chatty, but shows more restraint than his elder brother. Unlike his older sibling, who is completely devoted to the guild's success, Xingqiu is more reluctant to do so, putting him at odds with his family.\nHe is good friends with Hu Tao and Chongyun, though he pranks the latter consistently. He is an avid reader and spends most of his time looking for rare books at Wanwen Bookhouse when he is not preoccupied with his duties, writing his own books from time to time, with \"A Legend of Sword\" being one of his books. While it did not garner the popularity he wished for in Liyue, he is unexpectedly popular in Inazuma and Fontaine after an Inazuman merchant took the book back home with them; however, Xingqiu was initially unaware of its popularity in Inazuma.[2][3] Unlike the rest of his family, Xingqiu has notoriously poor calligraphy skills, with only a few people being able to understand it without needing it transcribed.\nBeing the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu is extremely wealthy and possesses a significant amount of influence, although he only resorts to using the guild as backup if the situation cannot be handled otherwise. Wishing to become a real life embodiment of the heroes he reads in stories, Xingqiu has a strong sense of justice and was able to revitalize the Guhua Clan despite being one of its younger members. He despises those who resort to underhanded methods or badmouth chivalrous heroes. Despite his carefree personality, he is also intelligent, capable of rectifying problems in his own unique way and has done so in a manner that people simply give up arguing against him if he gets himself in trouble. He claims that when his older brother takes over, he would have to do all the work for him;[4] likewise, Yanfei has a positive view on him, as she was impressed by how he was able to keep up with her train of thought compared to the rest of his family.[5]\nXingqiu uses the medium male model. He has golden-amber eyes, a light skin tone, and dark navy blue hair with asymmetrical bangs.\nSecond son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child. Parents in Liyue Harbor would speak adoringly of him, all secretly hoping that their own children would show as much promise as Xingqiu.\nBut even at a young age, mild-mannered Xingqiu had a wilder side too. Unbeknownst to his father and elder brother, he would sit for hours in the classroom reading fiction, having hollowed out used textbooks and snuck martial arts novels inside. After classes, he'd go out exploring and looking for all sorts of little ways to cause mischief.\nSometimes, his antics would even end up embroiling the Feiyun Commerce Guild in controversy. Luckily for Xingqiu, he always managed avoid blame by hiding behind an insurmountable wall of eloquent filibustering. Since no-one had quite what it took to beat him in an argument, eventually people simply learned to put up with his eccentricities.\nAn avid reader, Xingqiu's lifelong dream is to be the real-life embodiment of the chivalrous heroes from the pages of his books. For Xingqiu, chivalry is more than a standard of conduct — it's a mindset. The most chivalrous of all are not deterred by setbacks, nor do they stop to indulge their sense of satisfaction when things turn out as hoped. Instead, their minds are focused at all times on seizing the next opportunity to advance the cause of compassion and justice.\nDespite his young age, Xingqiu has already mastered the chivalric code and cultivated the eccentric mindset that comes along with it. This gave him a knack for the style of martial arts practiced by the Guhua Clan, and he gained some renown for effectively starting a Guhua renaissance. However, eager devotees who flock to the Guhua Clan's gates in search of the master himself may be disappointed to hear the gatekeeper's awkward response: \"The master is off in the mountains taking some time to himself right now... Maybe try again another day.\"\nEvery merchant in Liyue Harbor knows of Xingqiu from the Feiyun Commerce Guild.\nAll see him as a kind and well-mannered young man who is an excellent student, a top talent in every sense.\nAs the second-born son of the family, Xingqiu is not required to shoulder the burden of managing the Guild's affairs. However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers — that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants — and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.\nXingqiu's elder brother, while learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.\nHowever, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.\nSometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation. When asked why, he simply replies: \"A moment of solitude.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Xinyan is a fan of rock 'n' roll and returned to Liyue to spread it across the nation. Despite having difficulty in improving its reputation for many reasons, she is not discouraged and continues to play, appreciating all who come to her performances. She does not have any formal training for her music, having learned it herself on the go. As such, she is very supportive of others who show interest, even if they have no experience.\nHaving a fiery, hotheaded, and loud personality, she likes standing out in her own way, but many consider her to be weird and/or terrifying as a result. While aware of this, her attempts to make herself more presentable to them ends up in failure. Despite her rebellious attitude, however, she can keep her home surprisingly tidy.\nXinyan uses the medium female model. She has dark skin, amber eyes, and shoulder-length dark brown hair with dark red streaks and some orange undersides.\nXinyan owns a white, brown, and red square ruan with an axe-like bottom.\nCheck it out! Follow the flame that engulfs Liyue's nightscape and listen to the most breathtaking rhythms while losing yourself in this magnificent performance—\nIn a revolt against Liyue's traditions, Xinyan uses music as her weapon and fire as her battle-cry, to light up the darkest of nights until it is as bright as day.\nAfter this wild ride, when the dust of her dream-like rebellion settles, the only thing left on the moonlit streets is a few onlookers drunk with emotion, with a lingering aftertaste of her performance...\nAs well as the shouting Millelith trying to capture Xinyan, who was charged with \"fire code violation.\"\nEven though she had burned nothing but her impromptu stage, the young girl promptly retreated amidst the fiery blaze, waving to the audience on her way out. She took her instrument and rock 'n' roll with her, leaving only a riotous uproar in her wake.\nFor she does not wish to be pursued, just like in the song she just sang to her heart's content:\n\"An old lady asked me where I plan to stay. I said Yujing Terrace's flowers seem okay. When the Jade Chamber loses its shine, I'll go to Chihu Rock to climb, or maybe visit the dock where all the dogs like to flock.\nUnless the Yaksha takes away my soul, towards the crowds I'll continue my crawl.\"\nRock 'n' roll originates in Fontaine and is just starting to find its feet in Liyue Harbor, where Xinyan is pioneering the art.\nEvery night, she slings on her self-built instrument, steps onto her self-constructed stage, and plays her self-composed songs to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters.\nHer music reflects her personality: bold and defiant, loud and proud.\nShe is no virtuoso, but this doesn't bother her dedicated fans one bit as they let loose and enjoy the show, singing their hearts out and shaking off the stress of the day.\nIn the heat of the moment, the fire that leaps from Xinyan's Vision seems ready to turn night into day.\n\"She is a rare rock 'n' roll talent and a master performer who really knows how to create an atmosphere,\" said a review of one of her live shows in The Steambird.\nLiving in Liyue is expensive, especially when you want to enjoy the finer things in life. But as Xinyan would say to those tied down by worldly worries:\n\"If you know how to rock, then it's easier to roll.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

When she assumes her duties as the boss of the Yae Publishing House, she is known to be very kind and enjoys reading books and stories,[2] although she also shows an obsessive side in making profits at the same time. She has an enigmatic air around her, with her friends growing used to it.[3] When speaking with outsiders or close friends, she shows a blunter and more cynical side to her. Miko does not mince words, even towards her friend and master Ei. Being a kitsune, Miko is fond of fried tofu. She despises pickled foods of all sorts.\nAs a kitsune and youkai, she's very mischievous, including in her roles as Guuji and owner of Yae Publishing House. She couples this mischievous streak with impressive skills of manipulation and reading people. As such her tricks and pranks are usually elaborate, long-winded affairs towards rather simple ends, which she does out of enjoyment and the fact that she enjoys watching people squirm.[4] This has caused many people, such as Thoma and Gorou to become easily terrified upon seeing her. If not partaking in such affairs, she shows interest in those who get her attention.\nShe is one of Ei's only friends who survived the ravages of time. She tends to call the Shogun by her true name, Ei. Ei herself also calls Miko by her given name, signifying their closeness and friendship.\nDespite her light-hearted, mischievous personality, she showed a more emotional side during the Hyakkiyakou, indicating that she does genuinely care for those in her life and has considered thousands of youkai from across Inazuma to be her friends. Though in typical fashion for her, she quickly turns the Traveler and Paimon's sympathy into an opportunity to trick them into paying for an expensive dinner.\nYae Miko uses the tall female model. She has fair skin, purple eyes, and thigh-length pink hair.\nIn her regular form, Miko has purple eyes, and prominent red makeup painted at the corners of her eyes.\nMiko has long, muted pink hair that is tied at the bottom. She also has pink fox ears that point downward. While she lacks a tail in this form,[5] they briefly appear as a set of five translucent tails when she uses Great Secret Art: Tenko Kenshin, or as one tail when she uses Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura or when performing a Plunging Attack.\nBeing a kitsune, Miko also has a fox form, although she refuses to reveal it to the Traveler.\nThe Grand Narukami Shrine's head shrine maiden and a descendant of Kitsune lineage, Eternity's servant and friend... and the intimidating editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House, a publisher of light novels.\nThere's no need to uncover her every facet, as they are all reflective of Yae Miko. Yet, all the same, they are not revealing of her true nature.\nLike fragments of a mirror, each attitude reflects a different version of her. By being enveloped in many identities, she has become a brilliant diamond surrounded by countless mirrors.\nThere are hundreds of facets: solemn or cheerful, sympathetic or aloof.\nNo one knows the truth, just as how no one can easily spot a kitsune brushing past passers-by in the mystic woods.\nBut if the kitsune watches humans, where will her destiny lead?\nThe head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine, descendant of Hakushin's lineage, Eternity's servant and friend, and the intimidating editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House, a publisher of light novels...\nCome to think of it, Yae Miko's nicknames are as myriad as her changeable moods.\nThe number of people who have tried to \"figure her out\" for various reasons could fill the streets from the Tenryou Commission estate to Yae Publishing House if you were to line them all up, but to this day, very few indeed have succeeded.\nNot that Miko has ever intended to conceal anything, of course. Any capriciousness is but the result of doing as she wills and pleases.

    "lore": "Yanfei enjoys appraisal, reading and is very knowledgeable on many topics — most notably the law, due to her career as a legal advisor. With a strong sense of justice, Yanfei does not mind traveling to help her clients should they have trouble in different parts of Liyue. She claims to have extensive knowledge of the laws of the other nations in Teyvat — though, she notes Fontaine's law to be the most difficult. She is well known by the people of Liyue for her knowledge and is considered the premier legal advisor of Liyue, a title that garners her many a client across the nation. Even Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, states that Yanfei's memorization of the law allows her to quickly close loopholes in existing laws faster than she would have been able to herself.[2] When resolving disputes, Yanfei always gets all legal evidence beforehand to make a compelling and convincing argument. Although she can handle any case, she dislikes having to deal with civil suits. As many in Liyue do, Yanfei places a high value on the importance of contracts, though she is noted to place a higher value on them more than the average person due to the nature of her job.\nDespite having the blood of an adeptus in her veins, Yanfei is not particularly concerned about her adeptal heritage and is one of the few who did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis due to being born in an era of peace. It is not through any adepti powers or abilities that she may have that she endeavors to make life in Liyue better, but through her profession. She is very active and often talks a lot, a stark contrast to her adeptus father, whom Madame Ping states to be more solemn. She spends her time much like an average human does, and unlike most adepti, Yanfei doesn't consider herself above mortals in any way.\nDespite her playful nature, Yanfei takes her job seriously and practically, ensuring she and all involved parties of a case are well accounted for. She is also willing to do pro bono work as long as she isn't required to be deeply involved. Yanfei dreams of a day where people live honest and happy lives, and there is no longer a need for legal advisors. Should such a day ever come, Yanfei's backup plan is to become a rapper.\nYanfei enjoys tofu because of its versatility and availability. She dislikes cold food and she rarely eats them since her father told her that food was best served hot.\nYanfei uses the medium female model. She has a pale complexion, bright teal-green eyes with ovoid pupils, and salmon-colored hair that goes past her shoulders and fades to a pale peach at the tips. The hair around the sides of her head is chopped short at ear length in a fringe, revealing a pair of cream colored antlers[3] as a result of her xiezhi[4] heritage. In addition to this, the sides of her chest, ankles, and the backs of her hands have white diamond-shaped markings that resemble scales.\nYanfei is Liyue Harbor's top legal adviser. They say that she has memorized tens of thousands of legal codices and can skillfully apply the law in various situations. One can rest assured that she will aptly handle any legal case brought to her.\nBut this is not to say that Yanfei adheres blindly to the legal codices. Rather, she employs a degree of flexibility within the limits of the law and reason.\nThis half-illuminated beast protects the order of Liyue in her unique, effective manner.\nAll of Liyue's residents have heard of the famed Yanfei, no matter who you ask. Of course, as is the ancient rule in the City of Contracts, one seeking legal consultation or services from Yanfei must prepare a rather hefty sum as payment.\nLiyue is a port that prizes contracts and trade, and it is a place where wealth accumulates.\nMerchants from various nations are active here, which has contributed to Liyue's abundance, but has also brought up many disagreements. The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.\nThus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.\nYanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.\nShe is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her \"the law that walks.\"\nBut in truth, what Yanfei — one of the few half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis — really wants to do is live a free and happy life.\nAs for the copy of \"The General Law of Liyue\" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:\n\"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Yaoyao tries her best to act as a proper young adult to others including her seniors, such as making sure that they have a healthy diet and is especially fond of radishes. She is very curious about the outside world, having originally lived a life of seclusion with her parents around Qingce Village until she was taken in by Madame Ping. Yaoyao is very attached to Yuegui, whom Cloud Retainer made for her.\nYaoyao uses the short female model. She has fair skin, pale dark red eyes that are golden at the bottom, and golden-brown hair.\nIn the eyes of the people of Liyue Harbor, Madame Ping always brings the smiley Yaoyao along with her, and the two behave like a loving grandparent with her grandchild.\nIn reality, they are not biologically related. Yaoyao is the disciple of Madame Ping, also known as Streetward Rambler.\nAlthough she is the youngest disciple of Streetward Rambler, she takes care of her other seniors like an elder sister.\nIt is no wonder that Xiangling often finds herself thinking, \"Why does it feel like Yaoyao is taking care of me like I'm a child... Am I not the older one here?\"\nEven before becoming an adeptus' disciple, Yaoyao was always a warmhearted and considerate child. Perhaps it is for this very reason that the adepti are all very fond of her.\nYuegui, who never leaves her side, is an adepti treasure, crafted by Cloud Retainer herself. Yuegui protects Yaoyao whenever she encounters danger. It is just another testimony of the affection that the adepti have for her.\nYaoyao is talented and driven, the kind of student teachers dream of. Although she has had some embarrassing moments due to her not fully grasping the knowledge learned, this young child will no doubt blossom into a cultured and knowledgeable lady.\nMadame Ping is proud to have a disciple like her by her side.\nThe adepti faithfully adhere to the contract that they have with Rex Lapis, and have thus defended Liyue for millennia.\nWhen danger arises in Liyue, the adepti are sure to come forth, and they do show up from time to time when the land is at peace.\nSometimes, they do so to punish those who harbor evil in their hearts, and sometimes they intervene to save the imprisoned. And if they happen to meet someone with a destiny intertwined with that of the adepti way, they will take them as disciples and teach them their arts.\nAmongst the adepti, Streetward Rambler is among those who interact more with mortals.\nShe has a great many disciples, the youngest of whom is named Yaoyao.\nYaoyao is both talented and inquisitive, and while she is still very young, thus limiting her ability to fully take in what she has been taught and causing no small amount of innocuous mistakes in the process, she will in time become a most knowledgeable girl.\nShe also possesses a gentle and caring nature, and she treats people with earnestness and generosity. Not only does her master favor her, but her senior disciple and other elders in her life, too, very much dote on her.\nMost will never have the fortune to enter the adepti abodes in Jueyun Karst, but Yaoyao comes and goes between them both freely and often. Indeed, the love she receives from the adepti at her young age is quite an enviable matter.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Yelan is said to be quite secretive and mysterious; while claiming to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, she's frequently absent from work most of the year. Despite this, Ningguang tolerates her general absence while Keqing appreciates her work, although the latter wonders as to where she gets her intelligence from. She employs psychological tactics to catch her targets and get all the information she needs from them.\nOutside of work, Yelan approaches life at a calm and carefree pace. She frequently enjoys napping whenever possible, but will adjust her schedule as needed for the day's tasks. The reason for this is because of her physical frailty, a hereditary trait within her family. When handling particularly troublesome cases, she tries to save up her energy to complete everything in a single go.\nIn the presence of others, she is said to be very pleasant and polite. When alone, she's said to show a far different side of her as an extremely reliable, powerful and intelligent woman. She also has a high tolerance for spice, eating raw or dried Jueyun Chilis after deeming Xiangling's spiciest dish not enough for her. She dislikes sweets, claiming that they're too easy to get addicted to and disrupts focus.\nYelan uses the tall female model. She has pale skin, light emerald-green eyes, and dark blue hair and asymmetrical bangs that are lighter at the tips.\nYelan's identity has always been a mystery.\nLike a phantom, she often appears in various guises at the center of events, and disappears before the storm stops.\nThe people who are caught up in trouble look forward to meeting her. For some reason, most of them think she will help them, and if not, they want her to be their ally.\nBut the problem is, their opponents harbor the same idea.\nEvery one of these people has met a Yelan who goes by a different name and identity, and each of them thinks they can reach a partnership with her. However, everyone has been kept in the dark.\nWho does she want to help? When will she tell the truth?\nOnce she acts and intervenes, nothing can be trusted.\nWhen she reveals her true identity and speaks the truth, those who are eager for answers may not have the chance to hear it.\nLiyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs is an organization marked by transparency — from ordinary staff members of the Eight Trades to prominent officials of Yujing Terrace, every employee has their basic information documented in the Ministry's lists.\nYelan, despite claiming to work for the Ministry, is the sole exception. Most of her colleagues have never heard of her, nor is her name anywhere to be found on any rosters.\nThis does say something about her character — elusive, enigmatic, and erratic.\nShe is a ghost who walks in the middle of many crises under various names. But before the storms can come to an end, she has already disappeared without a trace.\nSometimes, she will pick a side in some conflict to offer her help, but those who receive her aid would be fools to celebrate prematurely, for they soon find that the same help has been extended to their opponents.\nHaving stepped into her trap, many have vowed to take revenge, yet none are able to tell what she is planning, let alone know where she stands.\nMany believe that she is a spy who works for some mysterious organization, and that her forte is stirring things up in the dark, which she then relies on to attain what she wants.\nSome even go as far as saying that she is a frenetic follower of disorder who neither serves any organization nor holds any meaningful purposes.\nEven if she does, all she wants is to add fuel to the already spreading flame and drag everyone down into a world of madness created by her.\nWith so many theories and guesses circulating, she has become a mystery. As for the truth, you could only hope to get an answer from Yelan herself.\nBut unfortunately, this is no easy task either — for it is always she who finds you when she wishes to, not the other way around.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

While appearing to be refined and graceful in formal occasions, she is also known to be exceptionally friendly in private.[1] She draws inspiration from many sources for her plays; she enjoys a wide variety of special drinks as one of her pastimes and she can write a play about one if she enjoys it.[2]\nDespite enjoying her passion, she also enjoys variety; while she gets along with the troupe in theater-related issues, she frequently clashes with them over personal affairs as she feels that they are too traditional. She is particularly fond of rock 'n' roll, visiting Xinyan and watching her performances at least three times a week no matter how busy she is. Xinyan believes that she comes to visit her due to the finer arts being \"suffocating\".[3] She tries to keep her visits a secret, as her interest in non-traditional music would cause much consternation among her elders.\nYun Jin uses the medium female model. She has a fair complexion, rich red eyes with prominent red makeup painted at the corners, and hip-length jet black hair with purple highlights styled in a hime cut.\nShe is the director of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe and is also a famous figure in Liyue Harbor's opera scene.\nYun Jin is known for her sweet singing voice and intricate costumes, as well as her animated and dynamic performances. Whether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.\nWhat's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\", the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.\nHowever, what is surprising is that Yun Jin, who has always displayed a dignified and elegant image, has a little hobby that is not known to the public — she likes listening to rock 'n' roll.\nIf you see Yun Jin at a rock 'n' roll performance in Liyue Harbor, please refrain from telling the whole world about it.\nOtherwise, she might get nagged by the elders again.\nHeyu Tea House has been a popular leisure spot for the people of Liyue.\nIts business thrives on two things, one of them being its boss Fan Er'ye's business acumen in inviting a top-notch Tea Master who tells the best stories of all.\nBesides that, there is also the performance of the acclaimed troupe, Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Its director and soul — a famed opera singer named Yun Jin — takes the stage at the tea house from time to time.\nWhile one can always get delicious delicacies or good storytelling as long as one knows where to look, Yun Jin's performance does not just await one there.\nAs a result, you can always find fans of Yun Jin trying their luck at Heyu Tea House.

    "lore": "Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man, who holds an air of nostalgia. Whereas he is said to have a stoic demeanor for duty, Zhongli also has a sentimental side.[2] He knows much about Liyue history and culture in part due to his time as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and memories, as he was a god well before The Seven even existed and one of the oldest still living in Teyvat. He holds philosophical ideas towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those that have been forgotten or warped over time. Zhongli tends to be humble, being worried he comes off as a \"bourgeois parasite.\"[3]\nZhongli tends to forget about Mora in transactions, agreeing to spend large sums of it without having any Mora on hand and even taking \"discounts\" as granted despite being an obvious scam.[4] He often ends up relying on his acquaintances for financial support, such as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or Childe. Although he works for Hu Tao,[5] he does not like her childish behavior.[6]\nIt is later revealed that Zhongli's \"carelessness\" stems from being the creator of Mora. With the Gnosis allowing him to create limitless Mora, he never had to worry about running low on his personal finances. Unfortunately, when he chose to live among mortals, he lacked the foresight to find an alternative for them to continue minting Mora in his absence, along with creating a retirement fund for himself. As a result, he shamelessly spends the Mora of others.\nBeing the reminiscent person he is, Zhongli enjoys Osmanthus wine as it was the drink he and his former Archon friends used to have when they met up in Liyue. He dislikes seafood as it reminds him of the promise he made to his people in the past when he fought a particularly annoying type of sea creature, although he does not mind eating them if they have been ground to a pulp.\nZhongli uses the tall male model. He has fair skin, amber eyes with yellow diamond-shaped pupils and red eyeliner on the lower lids of his eyes. He has mostly short, dark brown hair with a longer fringe on the right side of his face and Geo-amber tips that glow when he uses his Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst. There is one section of his hair on the back of his head that is waist-length instead of being cut short.\nZhongli's form appears to be the same as the one he uses as an Archon, as seen in his Statues of The Seven and various cinematics that show him as an Archon.\nThe Geo Vision seen at the small of his back behaves like other characters' Visions in most gameplay; however, it is not a real Vision, and there are a select few gameplay mechanics that reflect this.\nIn Archon Quest Rite of Descension in Chapter I: Act I - Of the Land Amidst Monoliths, Zhongli as Rex Lapis appeared as a brown and amber Chinese dragon with gold accents known as the Exuvia.\nOn the surface, Zhongli currently serves as a consultant for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. He works under \"The Director,\" Hu Tao, and seems to be well-versed in an abundance of subjects. This has earned him the respect of Liyue's citizens, granting him the label of an old-fashioned gentleman. However, this knowledge did not come from thin air. Zhongli is in truth the latest mortal vessel of the Geo Archon, Morax, also known as Liyue's overlord and protector: Rex Lapis. He now wanders the streets of Liyue, as he \"ought to be here to witness its rise and fall.\"[7]\nTo the people of Liyue, their Archon carries many titles: the Geo Archon, the God of Contracts, the God of History, the Lord of Rock, the Groundbreaker, and the Warrior God among them. Having lived for over 6000 years, Zhongli has first-hand experience with much of Teyvat's history. He has presumably witnessed many of Teyvat's events, such as the cataclysm, the creation of the Chasm, and the fall of Aria, Sonnet and Canon. Nonetheless, he is most known for his cold-blooded participation in the Archon War, and his founding of Liyue.\nAround the beginning of the Archon War, Zhongli was the co-ruler of the prosperous Guili Assembly alongside the God of Dust, Guizhong, and the adepti. However, their combined forces could not stop the tides of war from taking the life of Guizhong. During a certain battle, despite their efforts and the aid of the adepti, Guizhong was overpowered by the opponent and the Guili Assembly was destroyed. After a massive flood swept through the area 3700 years ago, Zhongli was forced to move his people south of Mt. Tianheng and established Liyue Harbor,[8] where it stands to this day.\nIn present time, Zhongli has handed over his gnosis and with it, he has lifted the heavy weight of rulership he has borne for millennia. As the gnosis is now in Fatui possession, Zhongli is no longer inclined to act as Archon. He now spends his time reminiscing and enjoying the mortal experience. However, it is not to be believed that his story is even close to being over yet.[9]\nWangsheng Funeral Parlor Consultant\nWangsheng Funeral Parolor's [sic] mysterious consultant. Handsome, elegant, and surpassingly learned.\nThough no one knows where Zhongli is from, he is a master of courtesy and rules. His grasp of Liyue's traditions is superior to that of any scholar. From his seat at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, he performs all manner of rituals. Proper clothing, auspicious timing, locations and appliances, observances and regulations, all such things can be left in his hands without a care.\nBut though he is a man of such particularity, he never has a Mora to his name. Trade requires capital, and transport demands payment, and yet Zhongli has no such thing on him — for in the end, someone else will always foot the bill.\nHe will attend the most celebrated performances, and be accompanied by the loveliest thrushes. His behavior is immaculate in every way, save for the matter of money. Those around him have long gotten used to his eccentricities, and do not take this matter to heart. If you ask him, he will say: \"Is that so? I don't recall anyone ever taking issue with me concerning money.\"\nMoney for goods — that is the norm. How could someone living in this world not comprehend its fundamental truths?\nHas the passage of too many years eroded his sense of mortal trivialities? Or does he see his voyage through this world as though it were a stroll amongst the clouds?\nIn Liyue's traditional customs, \"receiving adepti\" and \"sending adepti off\" are equally important.\nThe Hus of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, who have been in this business for 77 generations, are the masters of handling funerals. However, Hu Tao, the current owner of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, primarily focuses on the art of sending mortals on their way.\nFor the various ceremonies for sending adepti off, Hu Tao usually employs the help of a friend in more or less the same business. That person's name is Zhongli. The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts. This is not something one would likely witness twice in their entire lifetime.\nNot even the most particular and learned of researchers or scholars could find one fault in Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's ceremonies for sending adepti off.\nEverything must be perfect, from the costumes, the time, the place, the items, the weather, the scheduled length, the size of the permitted audience, to the stature, profession, and age of said audience. Nothing can be overlooked.\nWhen folk describe Zhongli as \"living history,\" the latter usually only smiles and sighs.\n\"I... just have a good memory.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Watching the two self-seeking merchants leave the scene with their tails between their legs, the Gestionnaire lets out a knowing laugh, then gives the younger, still uncomprehending colleague beside them a pat on the arm, and says:\n\"You see, the sword is mightier than the pen, after all.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

She is a popular perfume designer after having learned the trade by Kirya. While she wanted to follow in her mother's footsteps, she was particularly compelled to work as a forensic cleaner after one incident deeply troubled her.[2] Despite her work as a forensic cleaner, Emilie is not fond of talking about it, preferring to keep a low profile whenever the matter is discussed with her. She is also empathetic with others, willing to hear whatever they have in their minds, of which one of these granted her Vision.\nShe is good friends with Chevreuse and Chiori.\nEmilie uses the medium female model. She has pale skin, with choppy shoulder-length blonde hair fading to pink tucked behind her right ear, with face-framing layers curling in, as well as pink eyes with white pupils and light-blue flecks.\nWhen it comes to fragrances, sensitivity varies from person to person, but their preferences tend to be similar.\nFew in the world are amenable to every kind of odor.\nFresh, floral, fruity... Such are the scents of Emilie's perfumes, meticulously crafted, exquisitely presented, dazzlingly displayed on the shelves of Fontaine's Quartier Lyonnais.\nDated, decayed, decrepit... Such are the traces erased by her touch, everything made as good as new.\nIf you've never before heard of a \"forensic cleaner,\" you might at first struggle to imagine what such a profession entails.\nBut if you're lucky enough to become acquainted with Emilie, feel free to ask her a question or two. She is both an excellent listener and an exemplary respondent, so you'll no doubt receive a satisfactory answer.\nThere is much that may be said when discussing a bottle of perfume.\nWe might speak of its fragrance: How it first bewitches with its top notes, before gradually melding with its wearer, and finally taking a subdued bow amidst the lingering aroma.\nWe could speak of the concept underlying its design: Is it meant to enliven the spirit, or to lend an aura of alluring mystique?\nWe might even debate the most appropriate occasion for its use: Would one be willing to attend a social ball clad in this aroma, or would it be better suited to suffusing the atmosphere of a private date?\nEmilie finds these matters to be most worthy of discussion, as they are intimately related to how one selects a perfume. Compared to such considerations, the precise identity of the perfumer who prepared the scent is not a factor that needs to be contemplated when making one's choice.\nAlas, neither customers' views nor popular trends are easily shifted. A herd mentality that craves security often leads people to prefer purchasing from well-known brands or designers, for one rarely goes wrong that way.\nFame, therefore, is a double-edged sword. The more famous one is, the greater the odds of receiving negative feedback, and many are exhausted by treading upon such thin ice.\nBut Emilie, famous though she is within Fontaine's perfume industry, seems untroubled by such.\nHer products are free-form, spontaneous — indeed, she worries not at all about designing perfume, for her true profession lies elsewhere.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

Aware of the prophecy that would doom Fontaine, Furina assumed the role of Hydro Archon for 500 years; while she was successful in this task, it wore her down mentally so that she suffered from severe self-esteem issues and paranoia, as shown when the Traveler convinced the court audience that she was a fraud in her trial. Despite being undying due to being cursed by Focalors, Furina remained fearful of situations that seemed deadly, as she pleaded the Knave to not kill her during an attack for the Hydro Gnosis, and was hesitant in dipping her hand into Primordial Seawater to prove whether she is the Hydro Archon during a trial. As a result, she deeply fears rising water levels[2] or the Knave being mentioned to her.[3]\nUpon being freed of her role as an acting Archon, Furina had returned to her normal self, but without the burdens associated with her role. While she is still flamboyant and dramatic at times, she now displays a softer, humbler and insecure side of herself. At first, she struggled coming to terms with her role being over, believing that her newfound freedom meant that she was no longer needed, and had trouble reaching out for the people closest to her while she was the Archon, such as Neuvillette and Clorinde. She also planned to retire from the stage despite her love of acting, finding it difficult due to the mental ordeal of having maintained the persona of an Archon for centuries. After being comforted by the Traveler, Neuvillette, and Navia as well as getting invited to a party by Clorinde, she realizes that her journey of self-discovery means that she no longer has to live her life in solitude. Eventually, she is able to regain the courage to move forward and go back onstage for the first time since her abdication, and learns to accept her identity not as the Hydro Archon, but simply as herself, culminating in her receiving a Hydro Vision.[4]\nBoth as her time as archon and human, she is shown to greatly enjoy fancy confections and desserts, such as cake.\nFurina is a fair-skinned woman who uses the medium female model. Her eyes are heterochromatic and have droplet-shaped pupils: her right eye is light blue with a dark blue pupil, while her left eye reverses the color scheme with a purple outer ring. She also has beaded-like eyelashes. She has soft white hair with light blue streaks. Arkhe alignments cause changes in Furina's features.\nPneuma: Furina's hair is sectioned into two parts, similar to a jellyfish cut: a short wavy bob cut of white, and a layer underneath of twin strands. Both sport \"glowing\" blue streaks. Her outfit is centered around pale blues and white.\nOusia: Furina's hair is shortened to only the bob section. A single lock of hair, like a long ahoge, points towards the right of her hat. Her outfit is centered around dark blues and black.\nUndoubtedly, Furina has been much loved by the people of Fontaine from the moment she became the Hydro Archon.\nHer charismatic parlance, lively wit, and elegant bearing — all bear witness to her godly charms.\nBut perhaps the thing that she is most revered for is her unrivaled sense of drama.\nAs the protagonist of a famous play at the Opera Epiclese once put it,\n\"Life is like the theater — you never can tell when the twist will come.\"\nFurina is as inscrutable as the most cunning of stage characters, her course of action defying all prediction.\nIn fact it's precisely for this reason that the god of Justice and Judgment, unapproachable in her divine majesty, has such a bewitching influence.\nBut when the curtain falls, a hollow feeling invariably starts to creep in.\nThere are those who wonder whether there are moments in the dead of night when even a god like Furina feels the sharp pangs of loneliness.\nNo, surely not. People couldn't possibly imagine, let alone believe, that such a scene might play out.\nAnd that's indeed the way it should be.\nThat is, were it not for the fact that Furina's tears had already been silently washed away by the Fountain of Lucine.\nAs the voices of doubt have bubbled up like a torrent, she has been forced to adopt a higher-spirited and more unyielding demeanor in her defense.\nBut she must also continue to fulfill her duties at hand, and can't possibly let her weakness be exposed through the rise and fall of her emotions.\nThe advent of an impending disaster — long foretold by ancient prophecy — draws near. Faced with such times, what is a god to do? More than anyone else, she wishes she knew.\nFrom an onlooker's perspective, she seems distracted and weary — but she waves this off as a simple lack of sleep. As the Regina, loved and respected by her people, how could she let such buzzing naysayers get to her?\nNo — no matter how chaotic and urgent things get, she can't allow herself to drop the ball now, nor can she let all those years of hard work come to nothing.\nBeloved by all, the one and only star of this grand opera...\nWhether lonely, helpless, in pain, or in sorrow, and even if it means taking all the misery of this world onto her shoulders...\nHer will to protect the people of Fontaine — every last one of them — has never yet faltered.\nIt is unlikely that travelers from other nations will understand why the god of this land is regarded as a \"superstar\" unless they set foot in the Opera Epiclese.\nWhether at performances or trials, she will always be in the seat reserved for her above the audience, laughing, scolding, falling into hysterics, to the point where more often than not she makes a stronger impression than the action onstage.\nPeople buy tickets to indulge in new sensory experiences, and in this regard, Furina is by far more popular than the absolute justice that Neuvillette represents.\nThe forms respect can take are not limited to just lifting one's eyes up to a being above, and the unique form of respect Fontainians have for Furina is perhaps described better as \"affection and fondness.\"\nShe is not perfect, and may not even be very powerful, but while onstage, she is the personage the people trust the most, for she never disappoints.\nAmong Fontainian literary circles, there is a popular saying that Furina is a memory of spring never-fading, present in the hearts of all. And who does not wish for an eternal spring?\nSpring is transient, but she is ever there — follow the stage lights, and you shall see her.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "As the head of the Spina di Rosula, Navia is devoted to helping people of Fontaine, being likened as a \"big sister\" who checks in on everyone. She has a sharp mind and knack for investigating, being able to analyze events from different angles and find answers that other parties may miss.[2]\nDue to the struggles Navia had while growing up, she sometimes struggles to comprehend her own existence and wonders if she did anything meaningful. Despite having lost many loved ones throughout the years, particularly her parents Callas and Clementine, along with her trusted subordinates Melus and Silver, Navia still pushes on for a brighter future, not wanting their sacrifices to be in vain.\nShe had a good relationship with Clorinde in her youth, but following Clorinde killing her father in a duel, their relationship has been strained as she finds it hard to forgive her even after understanding his sacrifice. However, after solving the \"young women disappearance case\" with the Traveler and Paimon, Navia and Clorinde have started to talk and meet up with each other again to reconcile their relationship.\nOutside of investigating, Navia enjoys baking, particularly macarons.\nNavia uses the tall female model. She has fair skin, blue eyes and long, waist-length blonde hair.\nJudging from her appearance, there's no doubt that Navia is the very picture of a Fontainian lady.\nShe likes to accoutre herself in ornate dresses and fine hats, and carries with her a ribboned umbrella encrusted with jewels.\nThus bedecked, she flits around the streets of the Court of Fontaine, the slopes of Mont Automnequi, as well as lesser-known spots along the Fleuve Cendre.\nShe's never before been hindered by her long flowing dress, nor by her deceptively heavy umbrella. Spry as a sparrow, she is the bearer of glad tidings from the Spina di Rosula for those in need.\nPerhaps this is why Navia has become one of the famous reporter Charlotte's favorite subjects.\nAt the exhibition hall of The Steambird, there even hangs a photo connected to her called \"The Soaring Yellow Rose.\"\nBut there's no need to worry — for it goes without saying that the photo's subject not only consented to its showing, but also gave her enthusiastic support.\nFontaine's laws are very strict, but its people are quite free-spirited. Fontainian society contains all manner of social organizations, clubs, or factions, all of which have their own origins, development, goals, and style.\nFor example, the short-lived Hat Jellyfish Association ostensibly promoted the protection of the waters and those living within, but was in truth founded by a band of explosives enthusiasts.\nBy comparison, the Spina di Rosula are a law-abiding, reliable lot, their overly rambunctious young President notwithstanding.\nIn official statements, the Spina proclaims itself to be a citizen-oriented society that involves many walks of life and focuses its efforts on solving difficult issues amongst the common folk, and that it will cooperate with the Fontainian authorities where needed.\nIf you ask Navia, she'd tell you that the Spina serves as a business partner with all sorts of people in it, that will help with any problem, using the velvet glove or the iron fist as appropriate.\nNeither of these descriptions are mistaken, at least in broad strokes, so you may choose the one you prefer — though it is worth noting that those who choose the latter wording will find it easier to make friends with Navia.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

In the past, Sigewinne chose to adopt a human appearance in order to save a young child she befriended at a time where Melusines were looked down upon. However, her transformation was against Fontaine laws, resulting in her conviction to the Fortress of Meropide.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nSigewinne has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 2 Event Wishes:\nSigewinne has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "Sigewinne is extremely kind and wanting to help others wherever possible. When the Melusines first explored Fontaine, they were initially treated as monsters by the locals, but she managed to befriend a young girl and learned medical skills from a doctor willing to teach her. Sigewinne's determination in helping others culminated when her human friend became sick, but her parents shunned her because she was a Melusine. Not wanting to leave her friend to die, she willingly gave up her Melusine form to become more of a human with a special potion. After being sentenced to the Fortress of Meropide for breaking an ancient law, she chose to remain behind after her sentence was lifted to help its inhabitants, making her universally beloved.\nUnlike other Melusines, Sigewinne has a more intricate understanding of humanity due to understanding the concept of death, which the Melusine race is exempt to. She also understands that there are illnesses that cannot be cured, but she does her best to take care of her patients nonetheless.\nAs a Melusine, Sigewinne has naturally increased hearing and eyesight, allowing her to discern traits that other people might miss. Her interpretation of food is likewise unique, with Wolsey and Wriothesley considering her food \"unique\" despite her insistence that it is healthy.\nSigewinne uses the short female model. Sigewinne is a Melusine,[2] sharing a similar body type to the rest of her sisters, although she has a uniquely human-like complexion and set of hands.[3][4] In comparison, her pink eye color, tall blue ears with frosted tips and curled tail are much more reminiscent of a typical Melusine seen around Fontaine. Her hair color is pastel blue fading to a purple with white highlights.\nThe infirmary is the warmest place in the Fortress of Meropide, where the sun fails to shine.\nRumor has it that the head nurse, who manages said infirmary, is also its founder. The Fortress has changed hands in chaotic circumstances several times over the centuries, but there has always been a tacit agreement amongst all who live here not to harm the medical staff in any way.\nThe reason for this is simple — few doctors could endure treating criminals and staying in such a place for long.\nFewer still would be as clement, cute, conscientious, and considerate as Sigewinne.\nThere was once an inmate whose life Sigewinne saved after he had been gravely injured while causing trouble, who then proclaimed her to be an emissary of the heavens — an \"angel of salvation\" — sent to bring redemption to criminals, even saying that he would preach this far and wide on her behalf.\n\"That's a bit much, isn't it?\" The head nurse shook her head, her long ears bobbing along.\n\"I won't ask what you did wrong before saving you, but you'll still have to finish serving your sentence once you've healed up,\" she said, hands on hips. \"Flattery's not getting you anywhere!\"\nWithin the huge undersea facilities of the Fortress of Meropide, Sigewinne's infirmary is one of the few places open to all people at all times.\nA guard might have a terrible bout of illness while out on patrol at night, and have to be helped over to the infirmary by his colleagues, only to find that a hot drink and a clean bed had already been prepared, awaiting his arrival. Or an exhausted inmate might collapse from overexertion at their lunch desk, then awake to find their meal by their bedside, snug within an insulated container...\nAs they made these discoveries, Sigewinne's smile would also come into view, swiftly relieving both fright and fatigue, helping them to calm down and accept treatment and care.\nAll are in awe of her dedication, yet are also puzzled by the warmness of her heart.\nTo be consigned to the Fortress is a punishment in and of itself, and even the most youthful and energetic of guards must take a day off after consecutive days of work. Yet Sigewinne has taken precious few of these throughout Wriothesley's entire tenure as administrator. The lights in the infirmary are always on, and it seems that they'll never be put out... The motivation behind such enthusiasm may as well be an enigma to guard and inmate alike.\n\"Could it be that she is an emissary sent from the heavens to watch over us?\"\nWhat began as a single inmate mumbling away to themselves after seeing the wings on Sigewinne's back was swiftly taken up others, until before long the vast majority were behind it. In this world without light beneath the waves, she had become their \"sun,\" bringing a radiant warmth to their dark, damp prison.\nTo repay this \"angel\" for her care, the guards have an \"unwritten rule\" beyond the many administrative systems already present — any who are rude to Sigewinne are punished extra harshly. The inmates, for their part, also have an unspoken agreement that any particularly wild and violent newcomers must receive a \"warning\" upon being admitted. After all, they had to be made aware that the community would brook no affront to their angel, didn't they?\nSigewinne herself is blissfully unaware of all these customs that have cropped up around her, and simply serves her patients as she always has. However, there will always be some curious person who will ask:\n\"Head Nurse, why do you stay here to take care of us? Don't you get tired or, y'know, annoyed?\"\nWhenever this happens, Sigewinne's brows tend to furrow (a rare sight indeed), as though the question was absurd.\n\"Hmm... Have you ever had a pet cat? You take care of them, and watch them be cute in their various ways... That's something that makes you happy in and of itself, isn't it? Why would anyone ever get tired of something like that?\"\nMost who ask cannot quite believe their ears when they receive such an answer, and those they tell are even less convinced.\n\"Nonsense, if ever I've heard it! I'd sooner believe that angels exist!\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "As one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, Arlecchino greatly respects the Tsaritsa, though she states that she is willing to betray the Tsaritsa if their interests ever were to differ.[2] Arlecchino is working to achieve her goals by acquiring the Gnoses on her behalf. She handles Fatui matters with utmost importance and comes off as graceful and cordial.\nAs the Director of the House of the Hearth, Arlecchino is strict, but more lenient than her predecessor Crucabena, having imposed a more relaxed policy for her subordinates to complete their goals and does not punish them as severely for failure. She appears to have a soft spot for children, seeing that many members of the House of the Hearth are young and orphaned children taken in across Teyvat and views them all as her \"children,\" becoming particularly angered when their well-being is threatened or manipulated.[3][4] While she does not like betrayal, she is not as cruel, as she was willing to spare traitors who demonstrated sufficient willpower by \"executing\" their identity in the House rather than outright killing them. Despite being a woman, she is addressed as \"Father\" by the House of the Hearth's members; this is implied to be a rejection of Crucabena's ways, who called herself \"Mother\" and faked affection for the House of the Hearth's children while brutally mistreating them.\nArlecchino is disliked by her fellow Harbingers, who believe her to be violent and crazed beneath her stoic exterior.[5][6] These appear to stem from biased accounts of Arlecchino's past spread by Pulcinella,[7] with whom Arlecchino shares a mutual dislike.[8] Arlecchino allows these rumors about her to persist, as she believes deception to be a useful tool.[7]\nDespite claiming to be a Fontainian, Arlecchino actually hails from Khaenri'ah. Arlecchino knows little about her origins, only knowing she had some kind of cursed fire running through her veins from a young age. All she does know was related to her by Pierro when she joined the Harbingers.\nArlecchino uses the tall female model. She sports black eyes with red \"X\"-shaped pupils and layered black and white hair, styled in a long ponytail with asymmetrical bangs.\nTo this day, Arlecchino still recalls that night when she was first appointed as a Harbinger.\nUp the stairs and down the long gallery, with naught to see through the windows but a world of ice and snow without end.\nThe biting wind wailed loudly, now as mirthful laughter, now as somber farewell—\nWith a start, Arlecchino came to, the hallucinations of her memory mingling with the sounds of real-life conversation that surrounded her.\nThe hearthfire burned with vigor, its gentle warmth pervading the room, and its red light glowed on the children's faces, lighting up their innocent, unaffected smiles. If some uninformed passerby were to stumble in at this precise moment, they would surely mistake the scene before them for that of an ordinary, happy family.\nBut just as Arlecchino raised her steaming cup to take a sip of scalding-hot black tea, the clock began to chime — and within an instant, the laughter and cheer that filled the room were banished. The flames flickered so that for a moment the light faltered, the faces of all present cast in somber expression.\nPlacing her cup back down, Arlecchino stood up, and in a calm, measured tone, called out several names:\n\"Chapleau, you're with Lyney. Retrieve the required intelligence. Foltz, you and Filliol are on guard duty. Stay back and tend to the Hearth...\"\n\"Yes, 'Father.'\"\nWithout a redundant syllable, nor a hint of hesitation, they answered as one.\nNot long after, the fire had dwindled and the house fallen utterly silent, with nothing to be seen but a single shaft of infiltrating moonlight, peeking through a gap in the curtains upon a cup of gradually cooling tea.\nThe Hotel Bouffes d'ete, situated in the Vasari Passage, is a lovely building with clean walls and sparkling windows, and well-mannered, well-groomed children frequent it every day.\nUnlike other mansions of comparable beauty in the Court of Fontaine, the registered owner of this property does not live on-site.

But to most of these children, \"Father\" is the most important figure in their lives.\n\"It is only because 'Father' is here that this place is truly like a 'home.'\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

She is easy to anger and very self-indulgent, although she is shown to have a more self-conscious and embarrassed side to her personality. She became a great shaman even without having received an Ancient Name, though later she was told in vision by an ancestor that she would receive the Ancient Name Ukumbuko.[5]\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nCitlali has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 1 Event Wish:\nCitlali has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "She serves as a high priestess of the Mictlan tribe in Natlan and is renowned for her accurate predictions, earning her the affectionate nickname \"Granny Itztli\" among the Natlanese.\nHer decision to live in seclusion suggests a preference for solitude and introspection, allowing her to focus on her divinations and maintain a strong connection with the celestial forces she interprets.\nCitlali has a strong connection to her adopted grandson Ororon and feels responsible for his well-being. This suggests a past incident that has shaped her personality and motivations. This connection to Ororon, combined with her role as a guardian, indicates a deep sense of compassion and responsibility that drives her actions.\nCitlali has a short temper and generally scolds those that do something wrong, often expressing it with a harsh sting in her words and a stoic face. Deep down however, Citlali cares for those who she sees as her friends, especially the Traveler. However, she is afflicted with something that appears to prevent her from aging, and Citlali tries to avoid bonding with others out of a fear of getting too close to them when they died, as evidenced with an unnamed girl (who she brushed off as \"annoying\" out of habit)[2] and Huitzilin.[3]\nShe tends to stay at home, only coming out when something requires her utmost attention. Often while she is not outside, Citlali tends to binge on light novels from Inazuma and eat snacks. She is also an avid drinker.\nCitlali is a pale-skinned woman who uses the medium female model. She has long pastel purple hair with the ends fading into dark pastel pink and then dark purple. She sports dark blue eyes which fade into a lighter blue and pink pupils.\nWhenever a child starts crying uncontrollably, parents from the Masters of the Night-Wind in need of immediate relief are quick to make use of \"Granny Itztli\"'s name. Over the past two hundred years, many a terrifying rumor has been born from the horrendous defeats she has inflicted upon all challengers, eventually granting her prestige sufficient to silence wailing infants.\nAs the bearer of this title, Citlali has never sought to explain herself, as though she really is such a horrific entity.\nBut if you should dare set foot in her remote abode, you will find it a right mess of wine bottles and snacks, and shelves stuffed to bursting with light novels — and you would be forgiven for thinking of her less as some frightening old hag in her lair, and more as a hermit in her nest.\nAnd in this case, Citlali will feel the need to argue as such:\n\"I'm not a hermit. I'm just above superficial rules of societal etiquette!\"\n\"Shamans\" are practitioners of a mysterious craft who originate from the Masters of the Night-Wind. With many mystical abilities at their disposal, they are wise and powerful figures. In the eyes of the people of Natlan, whether one seeks medicine or wishes to decipher a cryptic prophecy, visiting a shaman is always the right choice. They can be both doctors and prophets, playing indispensable roles both in everyday life and in matters of far greater import. In short, theirs is a highly respected profession.\nYet above the many shamans, there are \"great shamans\" in a league of their own. They say it is a title that only those who reach the very pinnacle of their mystical arts may earn — and indeed, throughout the entire history of Natlan, they have been few and far between. Their deeds shine forth like the brightest stars in the night sky, adding a touch of legend to the already unfathomable shamanistic mystique.\nCitlali is one such great shaman, and the only one in Natlan today.\nYet contrary to what most might expect, you will not find her dealing with everyday matters, nor with major affairs, rarely even participating in events as significant as tribal ceremonies. For outsiders who seek the great shaman's assistance, navigating the many obstacles in their way may prove a greater challenge than traversing the many chasms of Natlan itself.\n\"Looking for Granny Itztli? Best not disturb her! If you really must go, go prepared — and just so we're on the same page, don't go dragging me into it...\" Thus would most members of the Masters of the Night Wind respond, as if Citlali were some formidable fiend, a monster of great menace and untold might.\n\"The great shaman... Mwahaha, she's your only option, isn't she? Pfff, the Almighty Dragonlord doesn't have time for puny punks like you. But since you asked so nicely, I'll let you use my name when you knock. That way, she's bound to take your request seriously.\" A certain oddball entity and self-styled Dragonlord might respond as such, as if Citlali were some easily dealt with triviality.\n\"Need Granny's help? You're looking for the right person if so — she knows everything about everything! Do you have her address? Actually, let me take you there myself! Oh, just so you know, when we get there, you'll have to keep knocking non-stop. Granny's kinda shy, so you have to be proactive, alright?\" This is the kind of response you'd receive from a certain top-ranking guide from the People of the Springs, as if Citlali were no more than a bashful young girl.\n\"Seeking help from Citlali? A wise choice indeed. Her assistance has been instrumental in the success of many of Natlan's most important affairs. I'm confident she'll know how to resolve your troubles too.\" That great leader, the keeper of the Sacred Flame herself, might say this, as if Citlali were the very epitome of a responsible and approachable elder.\nUltimately, after much inquiry, those seeking her aid often end up feeling even more confused than when they first set out, left with no other choice but to give up their petition as a lost cause.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "(To be added.)\nIansan is a small girl with dark skin, long ears and light green eyes. She has long gray hair, which she keeps pulled back into pigtails. She also appears to have white body painting near her nose and on both her shoulders.\nIansan wears an orange-and-black headband decorated with an animal skull. She wears a detailed orange, purple, and black jacket over an undershirt, along with a beaded necklace decorated with feathers resembling a dream-catcher. Iansan also has rings on her fingers and long black socks.\n\"Do you dream of pushing beyond your limits? Do you aspire to unfettered power?\"\n\"Why not take a trip to the Collective of Plenty to attend the Pilgrimage Victors Academy? Under the skilled tutelage of our world-renowned coach, we can help you break free from your weak, feeble self!\"\nMany visitors making their first trips to Natlan have received such flyers, and the fitness pedigree of the Collective of Plenty is well known. As such, more than a few curious souls have signed up to unleash their inner strength. However, when they first lay eyes on this \"world-renowned coach,\" it's not uncommon for aspiring athletic acolytes to feel cheated and ask for their money back.\nSuch situations fill Iansan with a sense of helpless exasperation. After all, even she has to admit that it's hard to draw connections between her child-like physique and notions of \"strength\" and \"power.\" For many, it's difficult to imagine how someone so diminutive could guide them to \"break free from their weak and feeble selves.\"\nWhenever this happens, Iansan invites prospective students to name a fitness activity of their choice, challenging them to compete against her. Still smarting from being \"cheated,\" it's rare that anyone refuses this opportunity to take their anger out on some fitness equipment.\nThen, once her erstwhile inductees have exhausted themselves trying to outdo her, Iansan picks up their discarded weights and racks up a dozen or so more sets by herself.\n\"How is that even possible? Elemental power? A blessing from the heavens?\"\n\"No, my strength comes from a well-scheduled workout routine, controlled caloric intake, and precise supplemental nutrition.\"\nEven after experiencing defeat in this manner, many trainees still harbor doubts over Coach Iansan's words, but most of them still sign up for her academy all the same.\nWhen the people of Natlan think about the Collective of Plenty, the first thing that springs to mind is the tribe's culture of fitness — followed shortly by mental images of towering, muscular, chiseled physiques...\nMany first-time visitors to the Collective of Plenty, therefore, are surprised to learn that the current leading light of the tribe's fitness scene is about as far away from those mental images as it's possible to be. As tall — or short — as a child, the young lady in question is positively scrawny when compared with most of her peers.\nThis young lady — whose unimposing frame gives the impression that a strong gust of wind might well blow her away — is the head coach of the fitness club at the Collective of Plenty: Coach Iansan.\nAt first, many visitors had assumed that the tribe were merely playing a trick on outsiders.\nBut in due course, there was ample opportunity for newcomers to witness Coach Iansan directing training sessions — and the aftermath, with her students collapsed exhausted on the floor while she herself had hardly broken a sweat.\nEventually, with the eyes of all Natlan watching, Iansan proved her prowess on the greatest stage, setting an all-time victory record in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.\nAnd now, Iansan is widely recognized as the gold standard for trainers in Natlan. She has even set up her own special training camp to teach the techniques required to attain victory in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.\nFolk are shocked by Iansan's strength and curious as to its source. There are rumors that she has an unusual lineage, one which bestows her with extraordinary strength, but also uncommon shortness.\nWhenever outsiders to the tribe attempt to confirm these rumors with the Collective of Plenty, however, their questions are met by little more than icy stares and an equally frosty answer:\n\"Hmph, she trains hard.\"\nHaving met their perfunctory burden of manners, the people of the Collective of Plenty will then return to working out, leaving behind befuddled outsiders who are unsure exactly what they did to cause offense.\nAnd so new rumors begin to spread, ones that claim Iansan's power is derived from a secret tribal weapon belonging to the Collective of Plenty — a weapon that they are forbidden from talking to outsiders about.\nWhenever such rumors begin to do the rounds, Iansan is quick to seek out the curious questioners.\n\"You too can be as strong as me. Join my training academy and I guarantee you results!\"\nOnce their shock has faded, most people decline the offer. Perhaps they don't believe that Coach Iansan can really guarantee success, or perhaps they've already heard stories of just how grueling her training really is.\nThe rumors surrounding Iansan continue to swirl and spread. On the rare occasions when she isn't training and has the time to pay them heed, Iansan can only sigh and shake her head.\n\"I keep telling them it's down to the training... Why doesn't anybody listen?\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Kachina is kind and friendly, but also very emotional and lacks self confidence due to the numerous near-death experiences she had suffered in the past. Despite this, however, she slowly gains more confidence in herself when being encouraged by Traveler and Paimon to successfully win the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, to which Mavuika recognize and acknowledges her potential.\nKachina uses the short female model. She sports dirty blonde hair fading into dark brown, light blue eyes that are brown on the top. She also has two big brown ears, similar to that of the American pika's ears, and small eyebrows. She has a short light-brown tail.\nJust like other younglings of the Children of Echoes, Kachina grew up surrounded by adorable Tepetlisaurs, shiny gems dug up from the depths, and heroic stories passed down by tribal elders. She came to know the mountain paths like the back of her hand, developing a great instinct and skill for searching out the treasures of the earth. In her leisure time, she and her friends would often visit the recording studios where musicians made their music, where they would dance freely to the pulsing rhythms. Growing up in such an environment, the occasional bump or scratch was unavoidable, and when she hurt herself, Kachina would cry out in pain just like any other child. But long before others had recovered from their pain, she would have wiped away her tears and stood back up again.\nOf course, she understands why the adults might see her as a good kid — yet she struggles to comprehend why she, of all people, was given the name of \"Uthabiti.\" For as the ancient poem goes:\n\"The one that dares stand firm as a mountain, their bones like battlements, and hold the sun's gaze — it is they that shall be given unto eternity.\"\n\"Fear itself should instead fear me, for my body is like a roaring blaze; destined to melt down all that is mean and lowly, then cast it once more as an epitaph.\"\nWhat part of her lives up to the lofty spirit embodied by this great name? The young Kachina has yet to figure this out. But having been granted this great honor, she is determined never to give up, no matter how many of her bids at the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame end in vain. Even if it means being ostracized and reproached by her peers, or feeling disappointed, inferior, and at times nearly overwhelmed by landslides of negativity... In the end, she'll wipe it all away along with her tears. Because one thing is for certain — that \"Uthabiti\" Kachina will never be defeated by her tears.\nJust like the other progeny of the Children of Echoes, Kachina grew up surrounded by adorable Tepetlisaurs, spending her time digging shiny gems out of the bowels of the mountains and listening to her elders passing down the legends of heroes.\nShe learned the mountain paths like the back of her hand, developing a great instinct and talent for finding minerals buried deep beneath the ground. When she had some time to kill, she'd be with all the other kids, running off to the music studios where artists were recording their newest tunes to just cut loose and dance freely to the pulsing rhythms.\nGrowing up in this environment, the occasional bump and scratch was unavoidable, and Kachina would cry out in pain when she hurt herself, just like any other child. But long before any other kid would have recovered, Kachina would have wiped away her tears and stood back up again.\nIn the eyes of others, of course she was a good kid. But Kachina still struggled to understand why someone as ordinary as herself was given the Ancient Name \"Uthabiti.\"\nJust what part of her was worthy of the ideals of strength this great name carried? Young as she was, she was unable to puzzle it out.\nBut having been granted this great honor, she had an obligation to participate in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. Moreover, returning triumphantly from the Pilgrimage and rising up like the heroes of legend was the dream of every warrior of Natlan — including Kachina.\nAs she experienced failure time and time again, not only was she overwhelmed with sadness, but she couldn't even lift her head to face the disappointed looks in the faces of her friends. Nevertheless, she would wipe away her tears, and stand up once more.\nBut having already failed so many times, could she really achieve success in the Pilgrimage? Kachina, who always gave everything she had, to fight on, felt doubt creeping into her heart.\nFriendship Lv. 2"

He is almost always seen with the egocentric self-proclaimed \"Almighty Dragonlord\" K'uhul Ajaw, whom he regularly quarrels with.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nKinich has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 1 Event Wish:\nKinich has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "To the general public, the Saurian Hunter appears pragmatic, cold, and to-the-point. Steady, direct, and efficient, he has a utilitarian approach to life, and his exterior coldness tends to discourage people around him from getting close. Appearing to understand more than he lets on, Kinich prefers to keep a distance from others and let everyone else do the talking. Kinich is often seen observing conversations from a distance, as shown when he was at the Pilgrimage alongside Kachina, Mualani, the Traveler, and Paimon.\nAs a core member of the Scions of the Canopy, Kinich is fond of extreme sports, and is said by his companion K'uhul Ajaw to have plunged headfirst off a cliff and lived to see it. Skilled in his abilities as a Huitztlan Saurian Hunter, Kinich assesses commissions and confidently sets prices without a hint of  chivalrous decorum, often causing others to look askance at the boy. However, Kinich appears not to be fazed by the opinions of people around him. As long as the price is right, he will fulfill all commissions in a satisfactory manner. Despite his reserved nature, Kinich has no problem making negotiations or talking back to others when the situation calls for it. Due to this, Kinich tends to struggle with the idea of receiving something for free.[2]\nIn the common occurrence in which Ajaw is bickering with him, Kinich is seen proficiently putting a stop to it, while without succumbing to anger or violence. When Kachina was under pressure in the Pilgrimage, Kinich assisted Mualani in comforting Kachina, despite his eccentric and logic-driven way of doing so. Despite his unfazed and realistic demeanor, he clearly exhibits good intentions and cares deeply about those who manage to get close to him.\nKinich uses the medium male model. Kinich has light tan skin, black hair with blue undertones, and lizard-like eyes split into two halves, the top being green and the bottom amber. One strand of his hair is curled upwards showing a yellow underside, and he is dressed mostly in green, blue, white, and black attire.\n\"It's one thing to charge a fee for delivering a letter, but charging for being a flame bearer on Turnfire Night? It's outrageous! Is this really a hero of ours?\"\n\"It's not like you just met him today. Surely you'd admit that he does his job well? That's all that matters.\"\nIn Natlan, where humans and Saurians live together in harmony, there have always been some who have looked askance at saurian hunters. In a land full of heroes, their practice of assessing commissions and setting a price makes the profession even more controversial.\nA cruel, ruthless, cold-blooded killer... Pragmatic, utilitarian, without so much as a hint of chivalrous decorum... In such heartless, damning terms do people describe the young man that never argues back.\nBut what of it?\nAs long as the price is right, all commissions shall be fulfilled in a satisfactory manner; all writhing, raging aberrants returned to the Night Kingdom from whence they came.\nOnce the bearer of the Turnfire name has locked onto a target, there's no looking back.\nNatlan is a nation where humans and Saurians live side-by-side, and this mutualism has lasted for many years.\nSuch relationships are for the most part friendly, with humans and Saurians as bosom companions.\nBut this does not mean that all Saurians approach humans with friendly intent. Even today, quite a few deaths still occur due to Saurian attacks.\nThis is why Saurian Hunters — of which Kinich happens to be a leading member — exist, deeply familiar with the weaknesses of Saurians as they are.\nHe is of no great age, nor has he been trained by any great master, but through many years of living out in the wild, he has learned the techniques by which he subdues wild beasts and wicked Saurians alike.\nLike a natural born hunter, he is steady, direct, and efficient, watching his prey with a gaze as sharp as a boning knife.\nBut unlike other Saurian Hunters, Kinich is far from limited by this profession. Rumor has it that for the right price, he will also prove himself to be adept at wet work.\nIt is because of this that many in the tribe keep a distance from him — though of course, some also do so on account of his realistic, utilitarian approach to life.\nRegardless of whom he receives his commission from, even if they're a person in a bind, or still a child, he will always request the remuneration he deems suitable.\nNothing can change this belief of his — that all things come at a cost. Such actions provoke confusion, but Kinich has no intention of explaining himself.\nIf you must have an explanation, you can get one, but only after he sticks out an open palm and asks: \"And what price are you willing to pay for that?\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "As the current God of War, Mavuika embodies a profound sense of duty and responsibility towards her nation, Natlan. This unwavering devotion earned her a place in the hearts of the Natlanese, where she is revered and respected for her leadership and commitment to their well-being. Mavuika's background with the Scions of the Canopy has instilled in her a passion for competition and radical sports, reflecting her adventurous spirit. However, in a conversation with Capitano, she acknowledged that she no longer possesses the youthful vigor she once had, with no longer being in her prime like she had used to be.\nIntelligent and calculating, Mavuika came up with a plan to eradicate the Abyss invasions threatening Natlan, driven by her desire to secure a peaceful future for her people. This ambitious plan came at a great personal cost; 500 years ago, she sacrificed her life in the Sacred Flame to be reborn in the present day with the sole purpose of realizing her vision. Mavuika is known for her willingness to relinquish anything dear to her, including cherished possessions accumulated over the years, in her relentless pursuit to safeguard Natlan from any peril.\nMavuika’s bravery is unmatched, evidenced by her decision to confront Capitano in combat to reclaim her Gnosis. She ventured into the Night Kingdom alongside the Traveler, displaying extraordinary resolve, and was prepared to face Capitano a second time to thwart his insidious plans to manipulate Natlan's Ley Lines with Ororon, a move that could have dire consequences for her homeland.\nIn critical moments, Mavuika often retreats into her memories, seeking clarity and reassurance to guide her actions. This contemplative practice was evident during critical events, such as the rescue of Kachina by the Traveler, Paimon, Iansan, Mualani, and Chasca; during the intense Abyss invasion in Natlan; and in the final confrontation against the Abyss in the Night Kingdom.\nBeyond her role as an Archon, Mavuika is friendly and approachable, cultivating warm connections with those around her. Her welcoming nature was particularly evident when she met the Traveler, expressing genuine surprise upon learning that their experiences in other nations had not been as harmonious as those in Natlan.\nMavuika is a tall woman with light skin and red eyes with yellow sun-shaped forms around her reddish-yellow pupils. She has red, knee-long, wavy hair with yellow undersides which resemble flames. It parts symmetrically.\nWhen Mavuika channels her power of the divine throne, her hair glows a fiery yellow.\nPrior to her ascension as the Pyro Archon during her time in Huitztlan, Mavuika wore a white dress with a red and orange accent alongside with a scarf. Her sun-shaped forms that are in her eyes were not present at the time.\nNow, how to introduce her? The bearer of \"Kiongozi,\" Mavuika, a leader completely worthy of leading the people of Natlan.\nThe woven scrolls and epics record all the most legendary of ancient deeds. Great heroes emerge, one after the other, and glory is passed down from generation to generation, and she has never failed to live up to such heavy expectations.\nShe who shoulders the title of the \"strongest,\" she who respects all beings, be they strong or weak, and treats all equally.\nFor this, the people love her, sing her praises, and follow her willingly, with all their hearts.\nEach time, when she addresses the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, her hair flutters with the Sacred Flame as her majestic voice rings in our ears.\nShe casts her inspiring gaze upon every warrior, every Saurian. She calls upon every flame of Natlan, uniting all fires into a bright light to drive away the darkness.\nAs we support each other, stumbling through the valley of the long, boundless night, wiping the tears from the corners of our eyes, and finally struggle to lift up our heavy heads—\nWe see naught but that unwavering, unchanging red, like the sun rising in the east.\nWhat did she sacrifice? What did she give up? What kind of will has led her to this day?\nWe have no doubt that she will lead Natlan to yet another victory.\nOur Sun will never set.\nWhen the name \"Mavuika\" is mentioned, the citizens of Natlan will not be stingy with their praise, for she has proven herself well-qualified and worthy of respect, be it as a leader or Archon.\nShe is the pinnacle of strength in Natlan, and she has the bearing to match. Even newly-arrived travelers need only hear her speak at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame to know that she merits being known as the sun.\nShe is exceedingly awe-inspiring, but is no unsmiling ruler whose ways may as well be set in stone. In informal situations, she is an enthusiastic and friendly big-sister figure, always ready to chat, and ever open to reasonable suggestions.\nOn the eve of the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, the Weary Inn is often packed with passionate revelers, and Mavuika can often be found there, playing cards or singing songs with everyone, and even if some drunk person splashes their drink onto her, she doesn't mind at all.\nAfter all, for someone who can ignite their hair to dry off said drink, such incidents are small beans. When such levity is hard to come by, why let something so minor spoil the mood?\nBut should the person intend to start a drinking contest, it is Mavuika's desire to win that will be kindled. As the \"battle\" has begun, there can be no room for retreat or surrender. The victor will be determined, one way or the other.\nSince becoming Archon, her habits have remained utterly unchanged, and this has allowed her to make many friends across the tribes.\nHowever, not everyone possesses the subtle sense of proper propriety for such a relationship. Indeed, she can be too down-to-earth, and with her lack of airs, some misjudge the situation and get the false impression that they can use their friendship with an Archon to their own benefit.\nStrangely enough, though people of this sort are a dime a dozen, they have never caused any major trouble, for Mavuika has never responded to such ridiculous requests — a solemn, icy stare is all she needs to send the other party scampering away.\nThe sight of those ever-burning eyes casting such a frigid gaze wakes those confused fools up in an instant to the fact that Mavuika is still the leader of a nation, a supreme deity.\nA Speaker's Chamber staff member once suggested that she should subject those who so harass her to at least token punishment, lest there be an endless stream of incidents to come, but she refused.\n\"Archonhood is status, authority, and a spiritual symbol. But it is not who 'I' am.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

She is extremely good friends with Kachina, encouraging her growth and helping her in her times of need — such as leaving her original team for Kinich to lead after learning that Kachina's team had abandoned her, helping her progress through the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, congratulating her for securing a spot for the Night Warden Wars[2] and immediately volunteering to rescue her from the Night Kingdom when she failed to return from the Night Warden Wars.[3]\nWhile she also runs a business, Mualani is rather carefree in her handling of it; she leaves her store open, but often unmanned and allowing people to take whatever they want as long as they leave Mora on the counter.\nDespite her easygoing personality, Mualani is also a skilled warrior, having participated in many pilgrimages, and is a three-time veteran of the Night Warden Wars without ever needing the Ode of Resurrection.\nMualani uses the medium female model. She is a tan young woman with blue eyes that fade to orange-red with a fish-shaped pupil, white hair that fades to light blue that has two long, slim braids coming from the underside of her hair and a ponytail that has a blue strand.\nIn terms of how well they know Natlan, perhaps even the birds that gaze down upon this land from high up above would fall short of the guides from the People of the Springs. Long, long ago, their forerunners once measured the world with their feet, transforming the winding, perilous paths they walked into networks of orderly lines on their maps.\nAs a member of the People of the Springs' new generation of young guides, Mualani has already established an eminent name for herself throughout Natlan. With her to lead the way, you'd be sure to experience the spectacular sight of volcanic eruptions, breathe in the refreshing natural fragrance of Embercore Flowers, even witness spontaneous performances put on by packs of Koholasaurs. But likewise, if there was an emergency or you just needed to be somewhere urgently, she'd find a shortcut to get you there as safely, soundly, and smoothly as possible.\n\"Everyone knows the routes,\" Mualani herself would tell you. \"But timing's the key. You can't just set off whenever you feel like it — that would be extremely unlucky!\"\nIf any traveler visiting the People of the Springs for the first time wants to try out the popular watersports here, like swimming, surfing, diving, or water polo... Everyone will recommend they go speak with Mualani, without exception.\nMualani operates the Leisurely Puffer, a store that specializes in products related to watersports. Her goods are expertly designed and of superb quality, while she herself has a vast wealth of knowledge in her capacity as a guide. Not only does she enthusiastically pick out colors and styles that'll \"bring good luck\" to her customers, but she'll also recommend the most appropriate hot springs, or the coziest seaside bathing spot and cleanest beaches — guaranteeing that her customers can enjoy a truly delightful and relaxing sightseeing trip.\nAs for those adventurers who are passionate about outdoor exploration and hunting down treasures in domains, they invite Mualani to personally lead the way... as long as they're willing to part with a bit of extra Mora. As a leading guide of the new generation, she has extensive knowledge of the wilderness and abundant experience. Whether her clients wish to just safely and reliably reach their destination, or enjoy a journey full of joy and surprises, Mualani will never disappoint.\n\"The most important thing on a journey is to have a good time on the way! The second most important is to pick a lucky time to set off!\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

He lives a humble life outside of the tribal grounds, tending to his vegetables and Phlogiston Aphids.\nToggle Ascension Materials\nTotal Cost (0✦ → 6✦)\nOroron has been promoted or featured with a drop-rate boost in 2 Event Wishes:\nOroron has not been included in any Chronicled Wishes.",
    "lore": "Ororon is a young man in the Masters of the Night-Wind. Similarly to his mentor, Citlali, Ororon is a unique outlier in that he is considered eccentric. Not only did he pick up on some of Citlali's traits, but he also preferred to live alone, away from tribal lands.\nIn his youth, Ororon was abandoned by his biological parents for reasons unknown, However, it was later revealed that he has a unique constitution of his own — he has a \"damaged\" soul, which is considered to bring ill tidings and misfortune by the tribe. As such, Ororon was ostracized despite being raised by the tribe, leaving him questioning the purpose of his life. The tribe originally intended to sacrifice him to bring lost souls back to the Night Kingdom, but the ritual failed, leaving him wanting to sacrifice his life to help others. This resulted in him agreeing with Capitano's plan.\nWhen the Khaenri'ahn soul Guthred attempted to wrestle control of his body to serve Capitano, Ororon realized that his life had further meaning than originally thought and resolved to make a more meaningful impact. This resulted in him being acknowledged by his tribe's Wayob and admitting that his initial support of Capitano's plan was flawed.\nOroron uses the tall male model. He has fair skin and navy hair with pale streaks. His eyes are heterochromatic, the right being magenta and the left cyan. Ororon has black wings on his back and animal ears similar to that of a bat, in addition to a dark blue marking under his left eye, and small fangs.\nOne scorchingly hot afternoon, a young man closed his front door behind him, then turned to say goodbye to the seedlings in his yard.\n\"Good afternoon, just heading out for a bit. Hope you guys grow a bit greener by the time I'm back. You've got this!\"\nHe returned with a friend not long after, offering a kindly heads-up as they walked past the large tree by the entrance.\n\"Big Pinecone's roots have gotten a bit out of hand lately, so be careful not to trip.\"\nNatlan is a weird and wonderful land, and the good doctor Ifa, having grown up here, was no stranger to Ororon's odd way of speaking. He remembered that long ago, an alpaca named Little Pinecone had bumped into that same tree, which might explain why Ororon referred to it as Big Pinecone.\n\"And it's not even a pine tree,\" thought Ifa, though he didn't inquire further.\nA weird and wonderful land indeed. It is a nation that embraces all living beings, whether their paths in life have been smooth, or not so smooth. All things have their cause, give rise to their effects, and in the end, serve their purpose. The flawed, the sly, the stubborn... all shall burn, flowing together as brilliant, vibrant soulfire.\nThe Masters of the Night-Wind's territory lies in the heart of Natlan, to the west of the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. From a distance, it appears much like a cloud of faintly glowing purple mist in the mountain valleys.\nThe impression left by members of their tribe on others is similar — profound, mysterious, and with a penchant for cryptic turns of phrase. Unless they're out traveling on a commission, such as for healing or fortune-telling, they seldom show themselves outside.\nOroron, however, is an exception. This is not due to an inclination for mingling with the crowds, but rather that he prefers exploring the wilderness. He ventures deeper and deeper in directions where few dare to tread, and even ten Tatankasaurs could not drag him back.\nWhat's more, \"where few dare to tread\" is not simply limited to a literal sense. All who have spoken with him know that keeping up with his train of thought can be... a challenge, to say the least. A test, if you will, of both wits and perseverance.\nYet it has never been Ororon's intention to pose such a challenge, just as the reasons behind many of his words and actions are actually quite simple and not in need of overinterpretation.\nTake, for instance, the time a kind-hearted passerby came across his dwelling in the wild. Wearing a concerned expression, they approached and asked, \"I see you're living all alone out here... Must have fallen out with someone in your tribe, huh? Is there anything I can help you out with?\"\n\"Of course not.\"\nOroron paused from his gardening for a moment, then stood up and gestured at the Aphids all around him, before responding earnestly, \"It's just that these little guys love this place, and I'm more than happy to keep them company.\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

    "lore": "Varesa has an insatiable appetite and enjoys competitive eating, especially after her daily exercises. She participated in the 242nd Inferno Stomach Supremo competition and won by eating 80 servings of Hot Spring O'Clock.[2] Even Mavuika expresses slight surprise when she learns that she orders a party tray for eighty that she eats all by herself.[3] During the preliminary rounds of the 243rd competition, she joined the other tribes' preliminaries out of her sheer love of food.[4]\nWhile a powerful and skilled fighter, Varesa is very kind to her friends and other Natlanese. Since they all share the common goal of protecting their nation from threats, Varesa is unable to take a fight with her fellow people seriously, resulting in her being quickly eliminated from the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame despite her capabilities. In her youth, she was timid and afraid, but resolved to become a hero when she grew up. She also understands how to properly use her strength, avoiding any possibility of succumbing to anger and harming others.\nVaresa uses a what appears to be a modified medium female model. She has pink hair, put up in two bubble braids that fade to cyan at the tips, and bangs. She has a large pair of horns with patterned tips, dark brown cow ears and a pink tail to match. Her eyes are dark purple with a light blue accent, and white pupils.\nWhen discussing the Collective of Plenty's tribespeople, the first instinct of the Natlanese is to praise their \"universal fitness,\" followed by a fond recollection of sweet fruits and fresh vegetables. Strength and abundance are the time-honored calling card of this tribe, with the most eye-catching pattern on that card coming from none other than Varesa's orchard—\nAs the cheerful call \"Fresh produce from Varesa's!\" rings out from the easternmost Children of Echoes to the Flower-Feather Clan in the far north, every tribesperson of every tribe can be sure that they shall enjoy healthy, all-natural, and delicious crops in the next few days to come. Her fruits are always intoxicatingly sweet, and her vegetables smack of rich, crisp petrichor — the taste of freshly rained-upon grassland bathed in sunlight. Over time, people have started erupting in heartsome laughter whenever they espy Varesa from afar, knowing a wonderful feast to be close at hand...\nIn the children's legends, a certain \"Masked Hero\" shall descend whenever evil beings and monsters run amok, wreathed in lightning. Charging at her foes with three times the ferocity of a Tatankasaurus, she delivers kicks as explosive as pyroclastic fallout, sending all the bad guys flying! The hero's battle cry when she executes her finishing move has become a popular catchphrase among the children, and the incredible swiftness of her departure is seen as the benchmark for \"heroic speed\"...\nAstute observers would discover that the areas where the \"Masked Hero\" metes out justice overlap neatly with the Collective of Plenty's trade routes.\nAs was their duty, the Patrol Team approached their colleague, Varesa, asking if she had encountered such an individual, to which Varesa responded while scratching her head in bewilderment:\n\"Umm... That sounds a lot like me, though?\"\nAt the unanimous nods of her team members, Varesa, who only just realized what they meant, suddenly felt shy. She vigorously shook her head, saying:\n\"I'll try harder next time — send the bad guys packing before anyone can even see them! But for now... I'm going to get something to eat first!\"\n\"Time for training, Varesa!\"\nEvery morning the coach would bellow her thunderous words, so loud in fact that a cloud of dust would rise up from the orchard.\nA few moments later, a core member of the Collective of Plenty's Patrol Team and the manager of a popular orchard — Varesa, who had overslept — would clumsily bumble her way into the gym, a slice of jam-coated bread in her mouth.\nAt this point, Varesa would listen to her coach's instructions with sleep-heavy eyes and a blank expression, before dutifully starting her warmups and slowly regaining her strength...\nOccasionally, her coach would point out — that jam contains too much sugar, which means it's punishment time! Only then would Varesa realize that, in her groggy haste, she'd picked her favorite condiment rather than the healthiest one.\nFaced with her coach's wrath, all a gloomy-looking Varesa could do was shuffle over to the most absurdly heavy barbell rack, all the while under the reverent, admiring, and dumbstruck gazes of her peers. That sort of weight would strain the physical limits of any normal human, leaving them with half a month of aches... Yet there Varesa was, performing some simple stretches, preparing to take on what even elite warriors would consider a \"lethal weight.\"\nBut in the midst of such seemingly inhuman training, Varesa would instead grow more energetic — and as the light returned to her eyes, she would begin to smile.\nSo it is that in the Collective of Plenty, whose people constantly pursue the pinnacle of strength, even its toughest warriors dare not challenge Varesa.\nBut if one wishes to investigate the source of Varesa's strength, they will soon find... that she lives a life far too laid back.\nTogether with her saurian companion Vanana, she manages her orchard, steadily works her fields, then sets up her stall to sell her harvest, which she does without a hint of hurry... Hearing about her daily routine is enough to put one to sleep, for there is nothing mysterious about it at all.\nNo matter how you look at it, isn't her life just as ordinary as any of her neighbors'?\nIn almost all respects, it might well be — but with the exception of her diet.\nOne more helping, please! And another, with more seasoning this time! Oh, and another, please — the bigger the better!\nIt's standard fare for Varesa to effortlessly inhale enough food to feed thirty, forty, even fifty people. Even an eating competition like the \"Epic Feast Showdown\" has to open a separate venue, especially for her...\nWitnessing such marvels, people can't help but wonder...\n\"Could it be that for a prodigy like her, the more she eats, the stronger she gets?\"\nFriendship Lv. 2"

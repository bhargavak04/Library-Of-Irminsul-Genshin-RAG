    "summary": "The Seven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBase\nCelestia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seven Archons, typically shortened to The Seven,[1] are the seven gods who preside over the seven regions of Teyvat, established after they or their predecessors emerged as the victors of the Archon War 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.\nEach Archon possesses a magic focus called a Gnosis, which allows them to resonate directly with Celestia.[2] By comparison, Visions are \"primitive\" — though a Gnosis's capabilities and purpose, beyond acting as a symbol of an Archon's status, remain unknown. Each Archon is bound to a Divine Throne, which is composed of the Elemental Authority of one of the Seven Sovereigns, and which grants them authority over the corresponding element.[3]\nAs of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty, only six Divine Thrones remain. The Hydro Archon's Divine Throne was destroyed, returning the Authority within to the Hydro Dragon Sovereign and breaking the established order of the Seven.[3]\nThe Archon War began an indeterminate time in the past, and ended around 2,000 years ago. During this period of time, many gods and archons roamed the land, locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. It appears that the battles associated with the Archon War are a multitude of local struggles that were grouped together by human history. For example, Barbatos became the first Anemo Archon among The Seven after the death of Decarabian 2,600 years ago,[4] while Morax is implied to have already become Geo Archon by the time the last of the original Seven claimed their title and thus brought an end to the War.[5]\nThe original Seven appeared to be relatively close, sharing a common duty of guiding humanity and often gathering in Liyue for drinks. However, over time, five of The Seven passed away, and some of the newer Archons no longer adhered to the duty of guiding humanity.[5]\n500 years ago, the destruction of Khaenri'ah led to forbidden knowledge pollution and the rampage of Rhinedottir's creations, which held the power of the Abyss and ravaged the world of Teyvat.[6] Among those who were perished in the ensuing conflicts were Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, Raiden Makoto, and Egeria. They were subsequently replaced by Lesser Lord Kusanali, Raiden Ei, and Focalors, respectively. The Tsaritsa was also greatly affected by the cataclysm, resulting in a drastic change in her personality.\nThe Seven were summoned to Tunigi Hollow, where the worst outpouring of forbidden knowledge and monsters was occurring. During the battle, Egeria was killed and her body turned into the pool of water known as the Amrita.[7] To preserve the water's purity and tether the god to the mortal realm, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm — which serves as a seal over the dark hollow and prevents the corruption from spreading further — from the Amrita.[8] The Oceanids, who served the former Hydro Archon but did not get along with Focalors,[9] made their way to the Harvisptokhm in search of their master. Seeing that her current state was not what they had hoped for,[10] they spread all over the continent and world itself.[11]\nDuring this time, the Traveler and their sibling descended on Teyvat and, seeing the chaos, attempted to leave this world, only to run afoul of the Unknown God. While the twins did not meet The Seven during this time, The Seven are aware of them and have been awaiting the Traveler's arrival.[12]\nAround 400 years ago,[13] Ei completed her research into creating a lifelike puppet, the Shogun, to enforce her vision of Eternity over Inazuma while she retreated to the Plane of Euthymia.[14] Ever since then, the Shogun has been ruling Inazuma in her stead. Though Ei failed to make her puppets compatible with the Gnosis and thus gave it to Yae Miko instead, the Shogun is capable of tremendous feats even without it.\nAn Archon's source of power has been attributed to three sources: the first is through presiding over their respective region,[1] the second is from their people's faith in them and the third being one the Elemental Authorities stolen by the Heavenly Principles from the Seven Sovereigns.[15] Barbatos, who refuses to govern Mondstadt directly and had left Mondstadt for extended periods of time in the past, claims to be the weakest of The Seven as a result; however, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was imprisoned in the Sanctuary of Surasthana and shunned by the sages since she was born 500 years ago, explains that her fighting skills are inferior to the Traveler's because she does not hold her people's faith.\nThe Seven appear to be privy to information that mortals are generally unaware of or deem to be merely fictional. Venti, Zhongli and Mavuika are aware of the existences of other worlds, as well as the fact that the Traveler had the power to travel between different worlds.\nEach Archon presides over their respective element and have used it to shape the landscape and climate of their respective territories. This ability seems to be held by any god and not only The Seven, but ever since the end of the Archon War, there have only been seven Archons at a time.\nUnlike humans, who rely on resonance with a Vision to use the elements, the Archons seen so far were already affiliated with their elements before becoming Archons: Barbatos was originally a wind spirit who ascended to godhood, historical records regarding Morax address him as the \"God of Geo\" long before he became the Geo Archon, and Ei (and by proxy, Makoto) is an \"incarnation of lightning.\"[16] Incarnations of Irminsul, i.e. Rukkhadevata and Nahida, are appointed guardians and maintainers of the tree of Irminsul. Nahida was created using a branch of Irminsul, confirming the connection between Irminsul and Dendro. Focalors (and by extension, Furina) was an Oceanid who was transformed into a human by Egeria using the power of the Primordial Sea, though Furina has since been converted into a full human. An Oceanid legend says that Egeria herself was created by the Shade of Life to take the place of \"the Primordial Sea's Heart\" after the Hydro Dragon was \"removed from that role.\" After the victory against Xiuhcoatl, the Pyro Sovereign, the first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque, bargained with the Ruler of Death, Ronova, to borrow her power to establish the rules that would aid Natlan's fight against the Abyss — the Ode of Resurrection and the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.[17] He also set up the systems and rules that would allow future mortals to ascend to Pyro Archonhood.[18]\nWhile people on Teyvat commonly believe that the Archons grant Visions,[19] they actually have no control over the distribution of Visions and are largely unaware of circumstances surrounding Visions.[20] However, within her Plane of Euthymia, Ei could enact the \"Vision Hunt Decree\" effect to seal all characters' Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts besides the Traveler's.[21] Because the Plane of Euthymia is Ei's personal dimension, there is not enough information to determine how this effect works or whether Ei is capable of enacting this anywhere else.\nWhile gnoses are described as being emblematic of an Archon's status and give them a direct connection to Celestia, their exact purpose and abilities remain a mystery. They evidently grant Archons a large power boost and the \"divine ability\" to defend their nations,[22] and Zhongli attributes the ability to mint Mora as something that \"requires the use of the Geo Archon's power.\"[23] The use of the gnoses' power is not exclusive to its respective Archon, as Nahida also utilized the power of the Electro Gnosis to aid in the healing of Irminsul. When Mavuika first ascended to Pyro Archon, it is implied that she threw away the vision she had as the Sacred Flame granted her significant knowledge and memory of Natlan.[24]\nEach Divine Throne is composed of one of the Elemental Authorities stolen from the Seven Sovereigns by the Heavenly Principles, and it is the Throne that grants each Archon their authority over the corresponding element, though what exactly this entails remains yet unknown. A great amount of power is required to destroy the Throne, and its destruction, resulting in the death of the Archon bound to the Throne, appears to be the only way to return the Authority contained within to the Sovereign.[3]\nOn multiple occasions, Archons have fashioned humanoid vessels using their powers as an Archon, perhaps through the use of their Gnoses. Venti's vessel was his first use of his newfound divine power after ascending to godhood as the Anemo Archon.[25] Zhongli's body was likely created through this method as well, as he states that his \"structure is not the same as that of normal people.\"[26] After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto \"reforged\" Ei's body after Ei gave up her bodily form so Makoto could ascend to the \"heavenly citadel.\"[27]\nAlthough gods are immortal, their physical vessels — including those made with the power of an Archon — have finite lifespans and can be \"killed,\" while their consciousness can fade away.[28] By the time of the main story, five of the original Seven have died and been replaced. While pondering how she would overcome her physical lifespan, Ei stumbled on a method of creating synthetic puppets indistinguishable from true life, which she used to create Scaramouche and the Shogun. After giving her Gnosis to Yae Miko for safekeeping, Ei discarded her physical form, the Shogun warning her that there was no return from giving up her body.[29] Due to no longer having a physical body, Ei is only able to manifest herself outside of her Plane of Euthymia by using the body of the puppet as her own.[30]\nVessels created through an Archon's power have another major weakness: they are incapable of being healed through ordinary means, including a Vision-bearer's healing abilities.[2] Venti harnesses the power of the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero twice to heal himself; first was to expunge the abyssal magic that poisoned him via Dvalin when the Traveler unintentionally interrupted them,[31] and the second was to recover after having his Gnosis taken by Signora.[2] The exact properties this tree holds is unclear, but it may have a connection to Celestia: according to legend, it grew from the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia.\nIn case of Pyro Archon, a mortal can ascend to godhood after winning the position through the Pilgrimage. As Pyro Archons are still mortals who age and die like regular humans, Natlan has had many Pyro Archons in the past. When a new Pyro Archon ascends to the Divine Throne, their \"inner flame\" will awaken, and the Sacred Flame grants them significant knowledge and memory of this land.[18]\nIt's important to note that vessels can be the Archons themselves and not different entities. This page specifically refers to a human body created by Archons to live among the people of Teyvat as vessel creation is not exclusive to the Archons, in fact most gods are capable of this feat.\nSome members of The Seven have worked through proxies who were not Archons but appeared to be so to the people of Teyvat. These include the following characters:"

The Guild collates all the complex word-of-mouth information it receives and redistributes it in the form of quests and adventures assigned to adventurers.\nEach adventurer is issued an Adventure Handbook, which is presumably, at the least, used to record their completed commissions and part of the system the Guild uses to pay out commission rewards. Once a Handbook is full, the adventurer can get a new one. Each Adventure Handbook has a unique serial number, which is also recorded when issued to an adventurer. It is unknown if old Handbooks are kept by the Guild, but their serial numbers become part of the adventurer's file.[1]\nA commissioner can choose to leave a designated commission with the Guild, which is only offered to the adventurer/adventurers listed on it by name.[2]\nWhile the identity of the commission submiter is usually learned by the adventurer in the process of carrying out a commission (such as whom to turn it in to, or asking a person involved of the details), if it's not necessary to know their identity, the Guild is obligated to keep that confidential. If, however, the adventurer is able to figure that out from a tidbit of information about the submitter that is not related to the commission itself, that is not any of the Guild's business.[3]\nLittle is known about the origins of the Adventurers' Guild. However, based on Lan's dialogue, the guild's main headquarters is based in Snezhnaya.\nBy speaking to Katheryne, the player can:\nThe guild has several branches throughout Teyvat, one for each of the major regions. Each branch has a branch master who is in charge of formulating entrance exams for new adventurers.[4]\nBranch masters can provide newly-arrived adventures to their region information and recommendations on where to go or not to go. Branch masters also seem to keep an eye out for ways that can keep adventurers safer when exploring ruins, and the more available and applicable the information can be to all adventurers anywhere, the better. An example would be a highly visual-based guidebook as many adventures are illiterate, or wooden models of machines and contraptions often found within ancient ruins kept at a guild branch for demonstration purposes, which is normally only learned about through word-of-mouth from other adventurers.[5]\nThe guild has two known departments, which are:\nThe Intelligence department of the Adventurers' Guild typically does not undertake commissions. Instead, they provide adventurers with vital information that they can use to complete their commissions. This department is split into two groups: the investigators and the organizers. The investigators are in the field and handle the collection of information, while the organizers take all of the information gathered by the investigators and organize it before providing it to adventurers.[6]\nThe organizers ranks the commissions based on difficulty (from Rank S to, presumably, Rank D) to help new adventurers adjust to the adventurer lifestyle, while also supporting veteran adventurers and allowing them to adventure more freely.[7]\nThe adventurers handle the commissions taken to the guild.\nThe Mondstadt Branch of the Adventurers' Guild, led by Cyrus, has a severe need for members. The message board in the Angel's Share is filled with recruitment ads from the guild. Cyrus even uses stories of dangerous adventures and bravery as a recruitment tactic towards the youth."

There is a total of ten Captains,[5] four of which are currently known (Albedo, Eula, Hertha and Kaeya.) Knights typically belong to a company led by one of the Captains or a special group like the Outriders. Although, there are a few exceptions to this like Klee, who doesn't belong to any company and is taken care of by everyone in the Knights of Favonius.\nBecoming a squire can be part of the path to knighthood. 16-year-olds are eligible to become squires.[6]\nHaving a position in the Knights of Favonius doesn't require a person to be a knight either. For example, Sucrose holds the Assistant Alchemist position, but she's not considered a knight.[7]\nMany people have acted as key members of the Knights of Favonius over the course of the game, with each of them assigned a particular job.\nNotable members are listed below:\nThe Knights of Favonius also employs many guards, with very minor roles and no apparent responsibilities, including:\nCompanies exist within the Knights of Favonius, each composed of knights specialized in a certain domain.\nThis company is headed by Kaeya. All the members of this company (except Kaeya) are currently on Varka's expedition. Diluc was the captain of this company before Kaeya.\nThis company is headed by Albedo. The Investigation company appears to provide the Knights with inventions to help aid their endeavors, and investigate strange phenomena. They have been known to utilize sophisticated Alchemical technology for remote reconnaissance.[10]\nThis company is headed by Eula. They often go into the wilderness of Mondstadt to perform reconnaissance and keep an eye on any approaching enemies or strange phenomena. Mika is a member of this company.\nThis company is headed by Hertha. This company's work are the charter and administration of the baggage train, resource management, and record-keeping. They are currently gathering help for potential missions of the Knights, such as dangerous monsters and troubles of Mondstadt's citizens in exchange for some surplus of resources.\nThe \"Combined Arms Company\" is a temporary designation integrating a balance of ranged and melee firepower. According to Phonia, the company is expected to be headed by Commander Frederica Gunnhildr, currently serving as the No. 2 in command of the expeditionary force.[10]\nThis company likely deals with magic. Its field officer, Nymph is one of the company's only known members, with Lisa having been a potential candidate for captain.[16] It is likely they are the elemental combatants of the Knights.\nThis additional group is headed by Amber, who is also the only member. They seem to be the archers and scouts of the Knights.\nThey were a subdivision of the Knights established and led by Amber's grandfather. They were trained in his style of archery and use of wind gliders, and were renowned for their skill. However, after his abrupt disappearance, the Outriders lost their discipline and skill while rumors milled that he had defected from the Knights of Favonius. Eventually, they were all but obsolete, with Amber remaining as the division's sole member.\nThe Church of Favonius, while a separate organization, is managed by the Knights of Favonius. The church is currently led by its Seneschal, Seamus Pegg."

The job of the Qixing is to implement the policies laid out by the Geo Archon Morax and manage the day to day governance of the region of Liyue.\nEvery year, one of the Qixing is selected to perform the Rite of Descension. During this ritual, the Geo Archon appears before the populace in his dragon–qilin form and gives predictions that shape the business trends within Liyue for that year.\nThe Liyue Qixing was formed roughly 2,000 years ago, following the end of the Archon War.[2] With the savage fighting between gods concluded, commerce and artisanship flourished, and those seven who prospered above all others joined to form the Qixing.[3] After aiding Morax throughout the Archon War, the half qilin Ganyu chose to remain in Liyue to help the humans build a new government. She took up the post as the organization's secretary, working alongside its changing roster for centuries.[2]\nFollowing Rex Lapis' apparent death, the Liyue Qixing quickly acted to consolidate their position and fill the power vacuum the god had left. Having learned through a secret message that the Archon was not dead but instead had relinquished his post, the Qixing announced to the people that he had passed in a trial, and took up the governance of the region without divine guidance.[4] In taking charge of Liyue, all of the Geo Archon's previous duties fell to the Liyue Qixing and the Eight Trades. With the end of divine rule, the Qixing began the task of reevaluating the old strictures and establishing new laws.[5] They also had to address the fallout of the events surrounding Rex Lapis' \"death\", including relations with the Snezhnayan Fatui diplomats and the cessation of Mora production at the Golden House.[4]\nThe role of the Qixing is to uphold the laws laid down by the Geo Archon[6] and attend to day-to-day affairs in Liyue harbor of all magnitudes.[7] They are considered \"the hands and feet of Rex Lapis\".[8] Each year, one of their number is chosen to preside over the Rite of Descension, in which Rex Lapis appears before the people of Liyue Harbor and delivers predictions that determine the course of business for the next year.[9] Both the Ministry of Civil Affairs[10] and the Millelith, Liyue's security officers,[11] report to the Qixing. Additionally, the Eight Trades, which represent the major industries in Liyue, are under the jurisdiction of the Qixing.[12]\nThe members of the Qixing are the seven leaders of the seven enterprises of Liyue.[9] Considered \"the cream of the crop,\"[13] all are highly accomplished in their own fields and are the pillars of Liyue's prosperity.[8] Their highly revered positions are coveted by many,[14] and some have many enemies. The current Tianshu, Uncle Tian, has consolidated his position for years through a strategy of pitting his enemies against each other.[15] Most members of the Qixing choose to play things safe and keep a low profile while carrying out their work. The current Tianquan, Ningguang, is a notable exception and is frequently seen around Liyue Harbor, making her the subject of much talk.[16]\nEach of the Qixing are equal in rank[15] and there is a clear internal division of labor within the Liyue Qixing's duties.[8] The Tianquan is responsible for maintaining the book of ancient laws laid out by Morax and all subsequent amendments. Each Tianquan has introduced amendments to ensure the laws align with Liyue's current societal needs.[17] The Yuheng is in charge of land, livelihood management,[18] construction, and real estate,[19] The role requires strict regulation and developmental direction[8] and is subject to over a hundred contractual obligations.[20] While each member has their own specialty, their roles can overlap. For example, while livelihood management matters such as water supply quality fall under the domain of the Yuheng, the Urban Areas Sanitation Act, addressing sabotage of water sources, was amended by the Tianquan.[18] Additionally, while the Tianquan personally maintains the book of laws and amendments,[6] other members also participate in law-making[5] and the Liyue Qixing as a whole is expected to interpret the law, address loopholes, and punish violators.[6] Some cultural affairs, such as the Moonchase Festival, are also overseen by the Qixing.[21]\nThe Liyue Qixing meet at Yuehai Pavilion in Yujing Terrace to discuss official matters.[22] Although the day-to-day operations and those who work directly under them are based at Yuehai Pavilion,[13] there are days where all seven attend to their business elsewhere.[8] The Yuheng, Keqing, frequently works away from Yuehai Pavilion at places including the south wharf, The Chasm,[23] and the uninhabited wilderness.[24] Likewise, when seeking a solution to important business matters, Ningguang sequesters herself in her Jade Chamber until she reaches a decision.[25]\nAll of the Qixing's decision-making is supported extensively by Ganyu, the General Secretary of Yuehai Pavilion. Behind the scenes, she is responsible for the calculations and data behind all of their policies and decisions. Every ordinance and regulation announced is also the work of Ganyu.[13] As general secretary, she is not attached to any one of its leaders, but instead supports the work of the whole organization. She has remained a constant associate to the Liyue Qixing since its inception.[26] Some members of the Qixing also have personal secretaries or assistants. Ningguang employs three secretaries, Baiwen, Baishi, and Baixiao, who are her closest and most trusted confidantes and aid her with researching important matters.[27] The Yuheng also employs assistants, but due to her extreme work ethic and perfectionism, her assistants typically last no more than three months.[28] Other secretaries, such as Huixin, also work at Yuehai Pavilion. They are junior colleagues to Ganyu and, like her, are not attached to a specific Qixing member.[15]\nThe Qixing founded and secretly runs the Wangshu Inn as an operation to covertly assist Xiao in his fight against evil gods, as well as to gather intelligence of any persons-of-interest entering Liyue.[29] All of the employees of Wangshu Inn are agents of the Qixing, and are among those who act as their eyes and ears, gathering intelligence across the region.[30] The Crux Fleet, an armed merchant fleet led by Captain Beidou, also works closely with the Liyue Qixing, although The Crux is an independent organization and not under the Qixing's direct control. Specifically, Beidou is a close collaborator with the Tianquan and was personally chosen by Ningguang to do her \"dirty work.\"[31]\nThe Eight Trades are the eight offices that operate the major industrial businesses of Liyue, under the jurisdiction of the Qixing.\nSo far, only four Halls in the Eight Trades are known:"

It is particularly renowned for its corpus in arcane arts and historical records.\nThe Akademiya accepts students from all over Teyvat and often sends traveling scholars, known as Driyosh, to other nations to gather material for research. It is unknown how long the Akademiya has existed, but it was already a prestigious institute by the time of the cataclysm 500 years ago.[1] According to Dainsleif, the Akademiya is a millennia-old institution, meaning it was founded over 1000 years ago.[2] The Akademiya also takes a role as a governing body of Sumeru handling much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru.\nThe Akademiya has three virtues and six sins. The virtues are described in Sumeru's Talent Level-Up Books, while the sins were deemed by the sages to be the sources of all crimes and banned to protect researchers from a careless pursuit of knowledge. They are the base of the Akademiya's rules, and the sages have been adding new rules and amendments ever since.[3] Researching topics that are related to these sins will expose oneself to punishments, such as expulsion from the Akademiya or imprisonment.[4]\nThe virtues are as follows:\nThe sins are as follows:[3]\nWhile it boasts a university-like setting, the Akademiya admits students of all ages, and children can be enrolled in the Akademiya once they reach schooling age if they pass the entrance exams. Arina and Armin are two known current child students, with past child enrollees including Alhaitham, who enrolled at the age of seven before being homeschooled for a time, Sachin, who enrolled at the age of nine, and Kaveh, who enrolled in the Akademiya when he reached schooling age, although his age at the time of enrollment was not specified beyond him being \"young\".[5][6] Uzayr, Shurayh, and Tanisha are also children who plan to take the Akademiya entrance exams after learning the fundamentals of architecture.[7] Collei is expected to enroll into the Akademiya once she finishes up her studies.[8]\nAlthough it is implied that there is a certain age at which prospective students should attempt the entrance exams and enroll in the Akademiya, doing so is not compulsory, as only those who pass the challenging entrance exams are admitted, making it unlikely that many students are actually able to study there.[7] Those who are unable to attend school in the Akademiya rely on the Akasha System, independent studies, or training centers to acquire knowledge.[9]\nStudents in the Akademiya commonly refer to each other as seniors and juniors; however, earning the title of senior is determined by academic progress rather than age. Tighnari, for example, is younger than Abattouy, but is referred to as his senior because Tighnari completed his studies and graduated from the Akademiya before Abattouy.[10]\nNowadays, obtaining a degree from the Akademiya is a notoriously long and stressful process; Gregor a student from Mondstadt, fears that his parents will be old by the time he graduates and returns to Mondstadt.[11] Hosseini states that it is not uncommon for people to graduate after the age of 30, and that he himself, being less than said age, has his hair turned near-gray from his research.[12]\nThesis defenses are by far the most difficult part of graduating; several of the Driyosh met in other nations express their anxiety over finding material for their theses and have changed their subjects due to extenuating circumstances or rejection from the review panel. Alrani downright fears the Akademiya, and mentions that Soraya — who is apparently among the top of her class — has \"piles of rejected manuscripts.\"[13] It is implied there is a limit to how long a student can stay at the Akademiya without being able to graduate.[14] Hosseini mentions that if he were to become a Dastur, he could stay at the Akademiya longer instead of having to travel around Teyvat to conduct research.[15]\nLisa, who attended the Akademiya in her youth, managed to graduate in two years under \"advanced study\" and is considered to be their best student in 200 years. However, she is not fond of her alma mater after realizing the cost of \"uninhibited erudition,\" having witnessed raving-mad scholars in Sumeru's forests and sages sitting in underutilized councils. She ultimately returned to Mondstadt and became a humble librarian,[16] a decision that greatly baffles those who know how talented she is.[17][18]\nOn top of academics, Sumeru Akademiya conducts research into various subjects. It is typical for traveling scholars to gather material and conduct preliminary research for their supervisors' projects and areas of interest,[12] while researchers are allowed to stay at the Akademiya to conduct their research.[15][19]\nAfter determining that no Electro Visions have been given out in the past year, scholars at the Akademiya theorized this phenomenon was related to the Electro Archon's will and in particular, the proclamation of the Vision Hunt Decree.[13] This theory turns out to be incorrect when Ei reveals to the Traveler that she was unaware this phenomenon was occurring, and that Archons are not directly involved in the granting or denial of Visions. Due to \"certain constraints,\" she could not say what actually caused the halt in Electro Visions.[20]\nWhile research at the Akademiya tends to lean towards study of ancient history, the arcane, elemental energy, and the fundamental bases of the world, it also bears research of the more scientific and practical variety. For example, Tsuyuko's education at Sumeru Akademiya has led her to believe that Watatsumi Island's Holy Soil phenomenon is not because Enkanomiya is trying to absorb the spirit of the island, which is the legendary explanation, but because seawater that touches the soil leaches its nutrients and washes them away; rather than suppress Enkanomiya, the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri replenishes the soil's nutrients.[21] It is later revealed that Holy Soil is the result of the expansion of the Light Realm, whose elemental currents are strong in Enkanomiya, while the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri reverses the phenomenon by awakening the Sangacorallia, creatures that can break down the Light Realm's powerful elemental energy into something more usable by the Human Realm which Teyvat is part of.[22]\nEvery year, the Akademiya chooses a recipient for the Pir Kavikavus Prize, an award given out to a young scholar under 40 years old, whose research submission is considered \"groundbreaking\" and \"creative,\" and the submitter has \"great potential.\" Past recipients of this prize have all gone on to win great renown in the Akademiya.[23]\nResearch into mechanical lifeforms is banned in the Akademiya, with students caught doing so running the risk of being expelled. It was initially tolerated and popular among those of Spantamad but when overzealous researchers began to perform unregulated vivisections and other cruel experiments on animals, it was immediately banned.[24]\nA few different honorifics and titles have been mentioned in relation to a person's progress in their research and studies at Sumeru Akademiya.\nThe Sumeru Akademiya manages much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru and is responsible for managing the Akasha System, a system which manages knowledge as a resource that anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal can access. The knowledge in the Akasha is compiled from the wisdom of the populace,[30] and the information a person receives is heavily regulated by the Akasha.[31] Yae Miko ponders whether this system was thought up by Lesser Lord Kusanali or by the sages;[32] however, it was revealed that the Akasha was the work of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.[33]\nThe Akasha is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power, but Lesser Lord Kusanali has little to no role in managing it. But as the First Akasha Terminal, she has always had her consciousness linked to the Akasha, giving her the ability to occupy the consciousness of anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal. However, she has only occupied the bionic puppet Katheryne's consciousness, out of respect for her people's free will.[33]\nIt is revealed that the Akademiya sages are corrupt; following Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the sages were disappointed with the newly born Lesser Lord Kusanali's lack of intelligence and thus sought to replace their god in an attempt to control knowledge and restore Irminsul. After Il Dottore returned to Sumeru to offer his assistance in making a new god, four of the six sages began harvesting divine knowledge from crazed scholars at a secret facility, using the Akasha to create a dream samsara to harvest energy and spreading misinformation about the King Deshret's revival. The Amurta sage Naphis and the Vahumana sage opposed the plan, only to be locked up by the other sages in response. The sages modified Scaramouche even further to create their new god.\nThe Akademiya under their rule was authoritarian, banning the transmission of information by non-Akademiya sources[34][35] and requiring plays to be approved by the Akademiya and to focus on Akademiya-approved themes,[36] before ultimately prohibiting public art performances altogether.[37] Even books, ironically enough, were not allowed to be openly sold to the general public. Only after Kusanali took control could material like Inazuman light novels be found in the marketplace.[38]\nThe Akademiya also has a significant influence on how the rest of Sumeru thinks, as their radical views that deemed artistic expression to have no benefits quickly caused the rest of Sumeru to adopt the same viewpoint, resulting in citizens valuing scholarly accomplishments and practicality above all else, and leading to the marginalization of those involved in the arts. The Akademiya's demeaning of the arts spread to all forms of artistic expression, whether in painting, vendor performances at Port Ormos, dancing, or even architecture, due to the value placed on practicality over aesthetics.[39][40] Even after Chapter III and the exile of the Sages, the Akademiya's influence still persists in some form in Sumeru, as discussing the arts is still considered the quickest way to kill a conversation.[41]\nAfter Scaramouche was defeated by the Traveler and Kusanali, Azar and the other three sages that collaborated with him were removed from their posts, with Naphis and the Vahumana sage being released from their imprisonment. Four new sages are to be selected in a process personally overseen by Lesser Lord Kusanali. Alhaitham was offered the position of Grand Sage, but he refused. Nevertheless, Alhaitham became the Acting Grand Sage to manage the Akademiya's important affairs before the new sages take office.[28] Out of concern that \"Acting\" would sooner or later become \"Official\", he would ultimately resign and return to being its Scribe, leaving the Akademiya without a clear leader for the time being.[42]\nIt is revealed in Kaveh's Hangout Event Act I - The Pendulum of Weal and Woe that training centers have opened up across Sumeru to prep citizens who are unable to enroll into the Akademiya for certain career paths, such as in architecture. However, some of these training centers, such as Alkami's, are scams that prey on citizens' desperation. The Akademiya is revealed to be unaware of these fraudulent training centers, and Kaveh speculates that they are unlikely to take action against them even if they were to find out because they have all of the necessary permits and certifications to stay in business.[7]\nSumeru Akademiya is currently divided into Six Darshans, each of which has a specialty and a designated color for their uniform.[43] The first Darshans were established at the same time as the Akademiya itself by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata under the name of Six Great Schools, each representing a type of wisdom. Each school is led by a Great Sage, and the central leader among them holds the position of Grand Sage. Although additional Darshans separate from these Schools have been created throughout history, only the Six Great Schools have stood the test of time. Nowadays, the Six Darshans and the Six Great Schools are nearly synonymous.[28]\nThe Mahamata[Note 1] are the civil administrative officials of Sumeru Akademiya. They are Akademiya alumni dispatched throughout Sumeru to oversee the transmission and integrity of information among the public,[44][45] relay and ensure compliance with decrees implemented by the Akademiya,[46] and regulate various Akademiya-run public services, such as trade[47] and healthcare.[48] They are also sent to investigate incidents which may threaten public safety.[49]\nPublic opinion of the Mahamata is mixed; some consider the newer Mahamata to be inefficient in their work and believe they could be replaced by the Akasha System, though with the system's shutdown this is unlikely to change.[50] It is also suggested that the Akademiya may forcibly assign students to become Mahamata regardless of the student's own intent. This has been criticized as subverting the Akademiya's goals of education, though others argue that the Mahamata are important because they distribute the Akademiya's knowledge to the public.[44]\nThe Scribe, a position currently held by Alhaitham, belongs to the Mahamata.[45] The title of Inspector, which currently belongs to an unidentified woman, may also be part of the Mahamata.[51]\nThe Matra[Note 1] are administrative officials in the Akademiya that hand out disciplinary actions to researchers who have committed serious academic offenses.[52] They also inspect for illegal sources of information, such as Canned Knowledge[53] and smuggled books.[54]\nThe Navbed is an administrative organization managing Sumeru's trade affairs and taxes.\nThe Vizier is an official who oversees administrative matters in the Grand Bazaar and Treasures Street on behalf of the Akademiya, and deals with inquiries from residents.\nLittle is known about this body, but they are known to hold some level of authority in the Akademiya, possibly including the authority to detain researchers. In Cyno's Story Quest, Lupus Aureus Chapter: Act II - Oathkeeper however, it is revealed that the Akademiya's Temple of Silence was in fact a front, as the real Temple of Silence departed from the rainforest back to the desert 400 years prior to the events of the game due to the sages' corruption, setting up a large compound in Thamud Oasis.\nNaphis is the Sage of Amurta.There are 40 other characters who are or were part of Amurta:\nAzar was the Sage of Rtawahist.There are 15 other characters who are or were part of Rtawahist:\nThere are 21 characters who are or were part of Spantamad:\nKhajeh was the Sage of Haravatat.There are 14 other characters who are or were part of Haravatat:\nThere are 27 characters who are or were part of Vahumana:\nThere are 20 characters who are or were part of Kshahrewar:\nThese characters are said to have held the title of sage, but their Darshan and time period are unknown unless otherwise stated.\nThe following members' Darshans are unknown; those with known Darshans are listed under their corresponding Darshans' sections.\nThe following members' Darshans are unknown; students with known Darshans are listed under their corresponding Darshans' sections.\nThe following members' Darshans are unknown; alumni with known Darshans are listed under their corresponding Darshans' sections.\nThe Bimarstan is a public hospital which provides free medical treatment from the Akademiya to residents of Sumeru. The doctors here are researchers and students from Amurta.\nThe House of Daena is the Akademiya's library, although it is now used much less often due to the Akademiya's recent push towards relying on the Akasha. Researchers and students can borrow books here on general knowledge. Some books are only open to higher-level researchers for use in their literature reviews. The House of Daena is run by a Grand Conservator, who is in charge of the library's collections.\nThe Akademiya is seeking a new Grand Conservator after the previous one declared his retirement; the current top two candidates are Rifaet and Vikram.\nPardis Dhyai is a research center for botany run by Amurta. Tighnari maintains close relations with the researchers at Pardis Dhyai, despite his avoidance of Sumeru City and the Akademiya itself.\nThe Corps of Thirty are an Eremite mercenary brigade who are under permanent contract with the sages of Sumeru Akademiya to keep the peace in Sumeru City. Effendi is the Akademiya's liaison officer to the Corps of Thirty.\nAccording to consummate liar Kasim, some of the Akademiya's sages are \"officially affiliated\" with the Fatui.[62] While little evidence towards this statement can currently be found, the sage Siman Farrokhzad[63] is connected to an Eremite tribe known as the Farrokhzadan, who have previously worked for the Fatui; she has ordered the tribe to search for Aranara,[64] which is a project Il Dottore is stated to be pursuing at present.[65]\nThe Order of Skeptics, named the \"Nagarjunites\" by the Akademiya, was once one of the Darshans. It has long since broken off and cut ties with the Akademiya, and while it still has some followers in the Girdle of the Sands region, many people in the forest region have relegated them to myth. Their ideals include \"the transmission of knowledge at all cost\" and that \"conflict is the natural order of Teyvat,\" which are deemed strange by Akademiya researchers.[66] The book An Ode to Khvarena mentions a figure named Nagarjuna, who is presumably the originator of the school."

    "summary": "Fatui\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestar Banner\n\n\nLeader(s)\nThe TsaritsaEleven Fatui Harbingers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFound­er(s)\nThe TsaritsaPierro\n\n\nBase\nZapolyarny Palace, Snezhnaya\n\n\nRegion\nSnezhnaya\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fatui also called the Warriors of the Pale Star are a delegation of diplomats from the Zapolyarny Palace of Snezhnaya. There is also a military detachment led by the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and the Tsaritsa herself. They are one of the two main antagonistic factions alongside the Abyss Order in Genshin Impact and the main antagonists in the official supplementary manga.\nA singular member of the Fatui is called a Fatuus.\nThe Fatui are a powerful military force in terms of power and numbers, making it the strongest of all the seven nations. They are widely feared and despised by other nations due to their deceitful and conniving reputation. The organization is composed of members performing a variety of roles, including combatants, bureaucrats, politicians, and merchants.\nHailing from the frozen lands of Snezhnaya, the Fatui are publicly seen as a political department of the nation that represents the goodwill of the Tsaritsa and manages foreign affairs with all six other nations. However, despite how they initially present themselves, the citizens and governments of those nations are often already aware of their true colors, and treat both their diplomats and individual members of the organization with distrust.\nThey often use underhanded methods to establish their power and influence in another nation, and as a whole are willing to go to extremes to further the Tsaritsa's vision for a \"perfect world.\" Deception, extortion,[1] and human experimentation are but some of the tactics they employ to bolster their own strength.\nDespite their loyalty to their empress, most of the Fatui grunts themselves are unaware of the Tsaritsa's true plans. The Harbingers are likely some of the few among the ranks who are truly aware of the Tsaritsa's true intentions, as they are the ones assisting her in collecting Gnoses.\nThe Fatui are divided into divisions, each of which is headed by one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Each Harbinger operates with a different modus operandi which also influences how their underlings act.[2] There is often a lack of thorough communication between fellow Harbingers,[3][4] Harbingers and their subordinates, as well as between different divisions of Fatui operatives.[5] However, some members of the Fatui are quite loyal to their leading Harbinger, to the point of being willing to seek revenge for their sake.[6]\nThe Fatui come from a variety of backgrounds: some were taken in at the House of the Hearth orphanage,[7][8] others choose to join their ranks, while others, like Childe, can be enlisted by their parents. They also do not hesitate to help financially and diplomatically strategic allies in order to interfere in foreign policy.[9]\nThey receive certain advantages in exchange for their services, such as supplies, salaries, or powerful weapons;[10] in exchange for this, however, they choose neither the destination to which they are sent, nor the superiors to whom they obey.[11]\nMany of the Fatui NPCs in the game are everyday workers who are oblivious to their superiors' true intentions, but are nevertheless very loyal to the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya. Members have differing opinions on being stationed in other nations, ranging from intense homesickness[12] to having developed fondness for their new home.[13]\nSo far, the Fatui's tactic to increase their influence in Mondstadt has been to incite or take advantage of disturbances to offer their assistance in a way that puts the Knights of Favonius in an awkward position. For example, they provoked Ursa the Drake into attacking the city so that Il Dottore could defeat it (later attempting a similar setup during Ludi Harpastum),[14] and one of their diplomats pressured Jean to allow them to kill Dvalin after the Stormterror attack.[15] Later during the Stormterror conflict, agents stole the Holy Lyre der Himmel, though it was soon recovered. A delegation of diplomats is currently residing in the Goth Grand Hotel, though they are apparently under lockdown.[5] During Eula's Story Quest, it is revealed that some members were colluding with Schubert Lawrence to invade Mondstadt, promising to help him establish the Lawrence Clan as the rulers of the city once again, though this plot was quickly foiled by the Knights of Favonius.[16]\nThe Fatui were presumably the ones who gave Crepus his Delusion, and were the ones who lured Ursa the Drake to his carriage, eventually leading to his death. They are also competing with Diluc to find a vial that contains the Anemo Archon's breath, which was stolen six months prior to the events of the game from one of the Temples of the Four Winds. Due to the amount of counterfeits that have flooded the market since, both the Fatui and Diluc have yet to find the real one, though Diluc has been purchasing every counterfeit he can find just in case.[17]\nThe Fatui also have plans involving the heart of the deceased Abyssal dragon, Durin, in Dragonspine, though the Traveler ends up interfering when they arrive.[18]\nThe Fatui used to have some kind of diplomatic immunity in Liyue Harbor (and an embassy),[19] and have been investing in the local economy through the Northland Bank, though the Liyue Qixing are wary of them. The Northland Bank is an arm of the Fatui \"with some exceptions\"[20] despite their receptionist Ekaterina denying this, being a national bank founded in Snezhnaya that has opened a branch in Liyue Harbor. The Harbingers are important clients of the bank, and the Fatui's Debt Collection division, of which Fatui Pyro Agents are a part, seem to assist the bank in tracking down debtors.[21] The Fatui also have ties to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor,[22] the exact nature of which are unclear.\nA Fatuus agent named Javert would make contact with Gentry Maocai in order to obtain large amounts of Cor Lapis, giving him some thugs to help force merchants into selling their stockpile lower than the market price. Gentry would later attempt to strongarm Chang the Ninth of his stockpile, but the Traveler and Xingqiu put a stop to Gentry's antics. Javert, realizing that he was outmatched and that Maocai wouldn't honor the contract, left, threatening the merchant of the payment. Gentry would be forced to buy the stockpile at triple the market price and likely delivered the needed materials to Javert afterwards.[23]\nShortly after The Chasm shut down due to a series of mysterious incidents, the Harbinger Signora had negotiated with the Qixing to allow the Fatui's Ninth Company to enter the underground mines to cleanse the mysterious sludge in the mines with an experimental device. The Fatui would investigate The Chasm, while the Millelith would deliver supplies and orders. However, the device exploded and the Fatui became scattered across the mines. The Ninth Company, a group of 64 soldiers, suffered such immense casualties from this that half of the men are assumed dead or missing including the company captain, forcing Staff Sergeant Anton to assume command, although not everyone has listened to him. By the time the Traveler discovers them, Anton has three soldiers remaining under his command. Begging them for help, Anton and his men learn what happened and decide to retreat.[24]\nFatui soldiers assisted Childe after he summoned the Overlord of the Vortex in order to draw out Rex Lapis, fighting against the Traveler, Keqing, and the Millelith on the Jade Chamber. Since this was effectively abetting a plot to destroy Liyue Harbor, this caused the remaining Fatui in Liyue to be looked down upon with suspicion and the Ninth Company in the Chasm was promptly abandoned and declared criminals by the Millelith, having lost all communication with the surface and desperately running low on rations, with some scattered groups bartering with Treasure Hoarders in the region for food.[25] Katarina is another notable Fatuus, having remained in the underground mines to search for her brother, who was separated from her.\nWhile relations have soured since Childe's actions, the Fatui still has a delegation in Liyue and is still interested in the nation's politics — upon learning that Uncle Tian had wanted to step down from the Liyue Qixing, they colluded with one of his disciples, Zhiyi, to assassinate and replace him so they could have influence over the Liyue Qixing. Fortunately, this plot was foiled by Yelan, who had been investigating Zhiyi, although the Harbinger Pantalone (who was monitoring Liyue's situation) managed to minimize the Liyue Qixing's advantage over the Fatui.[9]\nThe Fatui were the masterminds behind the Vision Hunt Decree in Inazuma, and fanned the flames of conflict on both sides of the Inazuman civil war. They colluded with the Tenryou and Kanjou Commissions to feed the Raiden Shogun false information[26] and gather materials for their Delusion Factory respectively, secretly distributed Delusions among the Watatsumi resistance forces, and planted spies throughout the country in various efforts to destabilize both Watatsumi and the Shogunate and render them vulnerable to Fatui influence.[27][28] They caused the Tatarasuna Incident by sabotaging the Mikage Furnace as part of Pierro's plan to lay the groundwork for a future endeavor in Inazuma; while unconfirmed, it was most likely the prelude to the Vision Hunt Decree plot. They were also responsible for the Tatarigami outbreak on Yashiori Island, as a Fatui infiltrator convinced members of the Watatsumi Army to destroy the wards on Yashiori Island.[28][29]\nUpon revealing the truth to the Raiden Shogun and demanding a duel before the throne, the Traveler prevails against Signora; as a consequence of losing the duel, the Shogun executed Signora with the Musou no Hitotachi. The Traveler later spends time with Ei after revealing that her Vision Hunt Decree was wrong, ending the civil war. She discovers the Fatui's involvement in Inazuma's policies and expels them as a friendly party.\nCapitano dispatched Naval Warrant Officer Borenka to cover up the Fatui's involvement in the Yashiori Island disaster by recovering the infiltrator's report and extracting any Inazuman recruits to be silenced. However, he and his group were defeated by the Traveler and Shizuru, who retrieved the report for Watatsumi.[28] Some of Signora's subordinates have stayed behind to avenge her, seeking to disrupt the peace treaty between the Shogunate and Watatsumi, though they were unsuccessful.[6] Another group from the House of the Hearth, led by Efim Snezhevich, also planned to reignite the civil war by poisoning Watatsumi Island; Efim believes this would raise the prestige of their patron, the Harbinger Arlecchino,[7] though it is later revealed that he had broken off with unsuspecting subordinates to advance the previous Knave's directives. This plan was disrupted by the defection of Lyudochka Snezhevna, and the Shuumatsuban is working to root out Efim's remaining associates.[30]\nFatui involvement in Sumeru has largely been from the Harbinger Il Dottore's projects. They collaborated with the sages of Sumeru Akademiya to replace Lesser Lord Kusanali with a new god of wisdom. Dottore was aware that the sages did not acknowledge Kusanali as a successor to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and he was intrigued by the possibility of creating an artificial god. He set up an experiment to turn the Harbinger Scaramouche into Sumeru's new god using the Electro Gnosis (previously acquired by Scaramouche). They successfully turned Scaramouche into the god Shouki no Kami, the Prodigal, though he was soon defeated and Lesser Lord Kusanali was restored as the deity of Sumeru. In the aftermath, Dottore recovered the Electro and Dendro Gnoses for the Tsaritsa via a deal with Lesser Lord Kusanali: the deletion of all his other Segments, as well as an exchange of information.\nFollowing these events, Lesser Lord Kusanali took Scaramouche under her wing. Upon learning the truth and scale of Dottore's machinations, he broke off from the Fatui and attempted to erase himself from Irminsul, though this attempt was unsuccessful. Upon restoring his memories via a backup that Kusanali had made to resist tampering, Scaramouche abandoned his name and the Fatui. As an effect of tampering with Irminsul, Scaramouche's seat would remain unoccupied for hundreds of years, with any further effects being unknown.[31]\nAnother of Il Dottore's projects involves weaponizing dreams and The Withering, and many of Dottore's subordinates in Dharma Forest have been tasked with aiding the project. Dottore is particularly interested in the Aranara, who possess the power to manipulate dreams, and his subordinates have been ordered to catch the Aranara for study. With the help of an infiltrator they have been trapping children from Vimara Village to lure out the Aranara, though such measures have consistently failed due to the Aranara's innate properties.[32] A related team led by Oleg set up research camps across the forest using machines with the goal of extracting energy from Withering Zones. However, the machines were not actually intended for that use and they had been tricked into using them by Kasim, a con artist. Oleg's team was eventually arrested by the Corps of Thirty and their machines were disabled.[33]\nUnder the guise of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament, another Fatuus named Elchingen would collaborate with dubious scholars from the Sumeru Akademiya, creating the Wisdom Orb in order to convince people to domesticate fungus for the tournament. The orb was also programmed to force control of the fungus, in the hopes that Elchingen could overthrow Sumeru with his army of fungus. The plot was foiled by the Traveler, Miko, Layla, Haniyyah and the Sumeran authorities. An unknown Fatui commander, deeming Elchingen to be too troublesome, ordered an agent named Yurochka to kill him, which he successfully did.[34]\nThe Fatui are also active throughout the Great Red Sand. They have been collaborating with Thutmose, an Eremite faction, in order to explore the ruins of King Deshret's civilization.[35] Separately, the Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team was sent to the Desert of Hadramaveth to study the desert tribes[36] and explore the Eternal Oasis, striking a deal with the Tanit tribe for aid. However, they were betrayed by Matriarch Babel, putting their efforts at a standstill. When Babel ordered Jeht to eliminate the Traveler, she refused the order, prompting her to lay a trap with the Fatui to eliminate her. The Fatui successfully caught her, but were terrified of her tenacity. Likewise, she told the Traveler of her \"betrayal\", hoping that one of them would kill the other, but the plan was foiled and the two destroyed the team.\nSome Fatui were also sent to the Girdle of the Sands for reasons unknown, with one officer, Markozov, seeking the Pari for unknown reasons related to knowledge, though Sosi believes that they were coveting the power of the gods. Markozov's group was driven off by the Traveler.\nThe Harbinger Arlecchino is the Father of the House of Hearth in Fontaine, and as such she is concerned by a prophecy claiming that the people of Fontaine will one day dissolve into the water of the Primordial Sea, leaving only the Archon Focalors to weep. Arlecchino and her operatives under the House of the Hearth were in Fontaine for the supposed reason of stopping the prophecy from occurring. Tartaglia was also sent to Fontaine to assist the Northland Bank branch there, but was (falsely) accused of being the perpetrator behind a series of mysterious disappearances. Though he was proven innocent, the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale still declared him guilty, and he was sentenced to the Fortress of Meropide. Arlecchino sent several of her agents to infiltrate Meropide and gather intel, though many of them were captured by Wriothesley. She also took it to herself to investigate the true identity of the Hydro Archon.\nThe Fatui are also involved in other operations throughout the nation. Henri was hired by the Fatui to collect parts from the Fontaine Research Institute for them, and was misled into extracting the cores of seven water quality monitor devices, being told they were polluting the water. The Traveler helped him, not knowing he was hired by the Fatui. However, Henri's boss was ultimately captured by Hunter and Turner, who revealed Henri had been tricked.[37]\nThe 34th Independent Investigative Squad was deployed to Mont Esus East, and took over several hydrological monitoring stations once used by the Fontaine Research Institute, claiming the Maison Gestion gave them permission. In truth, they were only pretending to work, as the squad (including its captain Malinovskyi) simply wanted to slack off but were being monitored by the deputy captain, Shumilov, who they did not like. In the end they were chased off by the Traveler, who was helping the researcher Broglie.[38]\nFollowing an explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute, Arlecchino sent several of her Fatui Operatives to investigate the matter. It is also implied that they entered a partnership with Edwin Eastinghouse and Nacker regarding Arkhium, as a Wind Operative can be found in Nacker's former laboratory in the Morte Region following his capture.\nUpon learning of some ancient ruins near Poisson, Arlecchino had sent a group out to explore it, but they soon learned of the Poisson disaster and devoted their resources to helping the people out, such as performing headcounts and monitoring water levels. When Lyney, Lynette and Freminet learned of the Traveler and Neuvillette's plan to \"trap\" Furina so she could admit her secrets, Lyney had the Fatui help him in replicating a larger-scale version of the trick he initially performed at the Opera Epiclese, who created a false house and made a tunnel from Poisson all the way to the opera house. They also assisted Freminet in finding a missing stone slate that the Traveler, Neuvillette and Navia had come upon while investigating the ruins.\nWhen the prophecy passed, Neuvillette gave Arlecchino the Hydro Gnosis as a \"diplomatic gift\", as both Arlecchino and Tartaglia provided invaluable assistance to the people of Fontaine and that he wanted to dispose of it after Skirk's urging. Arlecchino's role in acquiring the Gnosis would result in Pulcinella and Pantalone placing her and her organization in the spotlight of Project Stuzha, however she and her members suspected their sudden thrust into the spotlight was meant to keep them in check.[39]\nThe forces of another Harbinger (likely Sandrone) worked with a civilian named Jenck to steal Sir Arthur to help him take over The Steambird in return for finding Mosso Lombroso's inheritance and research in machine intelligence. The collaboration ended when Jenck destroyed \"Curve\", a lie-detecting Clockwork Meka created by Lombroso, and most of his research to avoid capture, so the Harbinger had him punished accordingly by breaking his mind and ripping his tongue out, leaving a letter apologizing to the Traveler, Paimon and Talochard. The Harbinger's subordinates were ordered to recover Curve's remains afterwards before anyone could act.[40]\nAfter giving the Gnosis to the Tsaritsa, Arlecchino returned to Fontaine and had a meeting with Neuvillette, where she gave him a proposal of her own. While he was initially hesitant to accept at first, upon learning the entire deal, he accepted the offer. Arlecchino proposed to him that there were members from the House who wanted to leave, but did not want to be targeted due to their secrets. In return for having their memories of the House erased and allowing them to live normal lives in Fontaine, Arlecchino would withdraw the majority of her forces from Fontaine and would not carry out any \"special missions\" in the nation unless absolutely necessary.[41]\nA newly certified agent would later arrive at Petrichor in order to collect a debt from Giulietta, who had defaulted on a debt regarding flute-making materials. When they arrived, another Fontanian, Giustino, hired them to bring him back to Petrichor, though upon arriving, the agent ambushed him, believing him to be the person owing the debt. After being beaten by the Traveler, the agent, who had been too enthusiastic with his first job, realized that he had targeted wrong person, as his main target was now in Bayda Harbor. He quickly left in a hurry in order to pursue her and collect the debt.[42]\nDuring Varka's expedition with the veteran members of the Knights of Favonius, they ran into Il Capitano and his subordinates, who were heading to Natlan. They eventually arrived, and Neuvillette states that Il Capitano had \"thrown himself\" into the nation's endless \"wars\". Capitano later confronted the Pyro Archon, Mavuika, over her indecision and failure to fulfill the oath made 500 years ago. In the ensuing duel, Mavuika managed to injure Capitano, who was able to retreat due to Ororon's assistance. Acknowledging his defeat to her and learning that she had spent her powers fighting him, he refrained from stealing the Gnosis and informed the Tsaritsa that he would abandon his task, which she accepted.\nGroups of Fatui were also sent across Natlan's plains. A group of Fatui were stationed in Coatepec Mountain, capturing the local Saurians under Capitano's orders to experiment on them regarding Phlogiston. The \"Polychrome Tri-Stars,\" a trio of prominent Fatui footsoldiers, were also sent to assist in maintaining the machine, though they would eventually wander to Huitztli Hill for reasons unknown. The Traveler discovered the facility and shut it down, freeing the captured Saurians in the process.\nAfter Capitano failed to acquire the Gnosis from Mavuika, he ordered his subordinates to instead focus on an alternate plan to rework the nation's Ley Lines by searching for the Source Mechanism. He also sent a request to be relieved of his duties of acquiring the Gnosis, which the Tsaritsa approved. Having interrogated three scholars and combining their research, they were able to locate the device and headed to a cave to activate it. The plan instead failed, as it awakened Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night, and creator of the Night Kingdom. As a result of the failed plan, Ororon became acknowledged as one of the six heroes for Mavuika's plan, and Capitano eventually agreed to support Mavuika, knowing that her plan had the potential for the best outcome. Thus, he ordered his subordinates to begin assisting the Natlanese, knowing that they would not defy him.[43]\nWhen the Abyss launched a massive invasion on Natlan, the Fatui worked with the Natlanese to fight the invasion off, suffering immense casualties in the process.[44] Nonetheless, after the battle concluded, Mavuika thanked Capitano for their invaluable assistance.[45] Upon learning of the False Sky after the invasion, Dottore also sent a small group of Fatui to infiltrate Natlan from Nod-Krai to investigate the Ancient Moon Remnants.[46]\nOnce the Abyss influence was purged from the Night Kingdom, Capitano merged his life force with Lord of the Night's, seating himself at the Throne of the Primal Fire as his consciousness was moved to the Night Kingdom to substitute Mavuika's sacrifice to Ronova. The Tsaritsa retained Capitano's status as a Harbinger. Aware of her plans with the Gnoses, Mavuika suspected that the Tsaritsa would send another Harbinger to collect the Gnosis.\nA group of Fatui led by Grudoc, who were affiliated with Pantalone, were sent to accompany a Fontanian merchant named Montluson to the Masters of the Night-Wind in order to search for evidence of the Battle of Seven Colors, as Montluson had created a special paint and was enraged when his profits failed to materialize, after a Fontanian tourist claimed to have seen the same color in Natlan. Pantalone believed that Montluson had the potential to become a giant in the painting industry and disrupt Fontaine's economic system, which apparently aligned with his interests. While Citlali and the Traveler defeated the Fatui, Grudoc proceeded to use a backup plan by destroying the sphere to avoid implicating Pantalone in the plot, presumably at the cost of his own life.[47]\nAnother group of Fatui set up camp by the Great Volcano of Tollan to investigate the kuuvahki, requested by a specific Lord Harbinger. Some of these Fatui participated in a feast involving Bifrons's green mushrooms, cooking at their camp.[48]\nThe Fatui Harbingers were recently summoned back to Snezhnaya and dispatched to Nod-Krai, following the highest of commands the \"Palestar Edict.\"  According to Helka, they brought with them with many construction materials, though she does not know what they intend to do. [49][50]\nThe Tsaritsa is the Cryo Archon and the Archon presiding over Snezhnaya. The Fatui Harbingers carry out her plans to seize authority from the gods, though her motivations for doing this are still shrouded in mystery.\nThe Eleven Fatui Harbingers are the executive officers of the organization, being under only the Tsaritsa herself. They are given absolute executive authority by her and answer directly to her. They are blessed with powers that exceed those of an average human, but those powers do not seem to be derived from their Visions. Instead, the Harbingers all possess a Delusion, which are said to be even more powerful. Those among the Fatui who have proven themselves in their strength are chosen by one of them to serve as direct subordinates. Each Harbinger goes by a code name instead of their real names and leads their own division within the Fatui. Currently, the only known divisions are the Debt Collection division and the Intelligence division, the latter also being known as the House of the Hearth.\nAll of the names and aliases for the Harbingers who have not received in-game introductions can be found in the video description of the Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo.\nThe House of the Hearth is a group founded by Crucabena, who is succeeded by Arlecchino. Unlike the other known Fatui groups, all of its members consist of orphans from all over the continent who are raised under a single group. Once the orphans have come of age, they enlist in the Fatui and either continue to serve Arlecchino, or transfer to a different Harbinger's command.\nThere are 21 other characters who are (or were) part of the House of the Hearth:\nThis company was dispatched by Pulcinella to The Chasm: Underground Mines to investigate its recent strange phenomena as part of an agreement between Snezhnaya and the Liyue Qixing. After Tartaglia's actions in Liyue Harbor, this arrangement was nullified and the supply chains were cut off, but the company stayed, unaware of the events at the surface.\nThe company originally contained 64 members, but Anton estimates that half of the soldiers have gone missing or died to accidents within the Chasm. Since the company's captain had also gone missing, Anton declared himself as the Brevet Captain (acting commanding officer).\nIts members included:\nThe Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team was sent to the Desert of Hadramaveth to investigate the status of the desert tribes for Dottore[36] as well as explore the Eternal Oasis venerated by the Eremites. The expedition commander, Professor Froderock Fronkonsteen, also wished to obtain a member of the desert tribes for experimentation.[62] They struck a deal with the Tanit tribe; they would supply the Tanit with Snezhnayan supplies and technical documents and help Babel consolidate power in exchange for the tribe's help exploring the oasis. However, Babel betrayed them, resulting in the Fatui becoming scattered and unable to advance.[62] They briefly work with Aderfi and Azariq to overthrow Babel, but this fails after the Traveler and Jeht kill the two \"traitors.\"\nEventually, the expedition team ends their negotiations with the Tanit with a deal to get rid of Jeht, who would be taken as their test subject. They capture Jeht and take her to their ad-hoc headquarters at Wadi Al-Majuj to be transported out of the desert. Jeht ultimately breaks free and slaughters her way through the camp, likely killing Professor Fronkensteen as well.[63]\nIts members included:\nThis unit was dispatched to Fontaine, though they are not actually following any orders and are just pretending to investigate the Fontaine Research Institute to appease their strict deputy captain.\nIts members include:"

It is the nation led by Mavuika, the Pyro Archon and God of War.\nArchon Quest Chapter V takes place in this region.\nNatlan is located beyond the west side of Sumeru's desert region, the Great Red Sand, from the Desert of Hadramaveth. It is also home to natural hot springs created from volcanic activity.[3][4] Its people are grouped into tribes, and each tribe follows different rules.[5] During Tenoch's era 500 years ago, there were at least six major tribes in Natlan, of which all are extant by the time the Traveler arrives there.[6]\nAccording to Neuvillette, dragons in Natlan, called Saurians, have undergone long-term development and evolution with a large number of them coexisting with humanity. He also details that war is a constant in Natlan that ravages the land like an undying flame. Capitano, the First of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, was also noted to be present in the region participating in the conflicts.[7]\nAccording to Ranjit, people in Natlan have a lot of reservations about leaving their homeland, but he doesn't feel comfortable talking about it as a foreigner. He does not believe it is due to a fear of unfamiliar environments.[8] On this, Mavuika clarifies that the reason is due to the people's survival being tied with the Wayob against the Abyss; even if left with no choice, those departing Natlan must seek their tribal chief's approval with the Wayob in order to grant them leave.[9] After the Abyss was purged from the Night Kingdom, the rule no longer applies and Natlanese are able to leave the nation as they wish without consequences.

Childe claims that people would literally freeze to death if they didn't keep moving outside.

The description for Agent's Sacrificial Knife calls it a \"weapon made with superior Snezhnayan technology.\" The Fatui Skirmishers wear mechanical suits of varying degrees, and some of its members use guns and cannons in battle.

During this time, monsters created by the alchemist Rhinedottir, also known as \"Gold,\" poured out from Khaenri'ah to invade Teyvat, and Khaenri'ah was eventually destroyed by Celestia and the gods. Afterwards, all Khaenri'ahns who were not \"pure-blooded\" were turned into monsters, whereas all \"pure-blooded\" Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality.[4]\nDespite its destruction and the transformation of many of its people into monsters, some Khaenri'ahns are still wandering through Teyvat. Dainsleif — a denizen of Khaenri'ah and the narrator of Travail — describes it as one of \"the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall,\" and says that its people \"dream of dreaming,\" unlike the majority who are \"content to live, and not to dream.\"[5]\nAccording to Kaeya, it is said that Khaenri'ah is located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru.[6] The Khaenri'ahn installation known as Hangeh Afrasiyab guards a giant, tightly sealed stone gate beneath it that most likely leads to Khaenri'ah.[7]\nArchon Quest Chapter ?? takes place in this region.\nKhaenri'ah is deep underground and is mostly barren of natural life. What is currently known about Khaenri'ah largely comes from weapon and artifact descriptions, as well as books found throughout the world. According to Dainsleif, it is the \"pride of humanity\", as it was built purely by humans without involvement from any god, but it was later destroyed by the gods.[8]\nThe practice of the Art of Khemia[9] and the use of forbidden knowledge[10] led to the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah's ruin. Around 500 years ago, King Irmin introduced forbidden knowledge to enhance the kingdom's technological advancement. The alchemist Rhinedottir also used it in her experiments to develop powerful creatures containing the power of the Abyss, including Durin, Elynas, and the Riftwolves. For some reason, these creatures began wreaking havoc throughout Khaenri'ah and then spread into the rest of Teyvat.[11]\nIn response,[12] the gods of Celestia and six of The Seven[13] launched an assault on Khaenri'ah. The skies turned red and filled with crimson cubes, (possibly the work of the Unknown God), and the landmass the kingdom was built on was torn to pieces, with lava flooding the shattered fragments of it.[14] While the gods were victorious, at least two of The Seven — the Hydro Archon Egeria and the Electro Archon Raiden Makoto[15] — were killed. A third Archon, the Dendro Archon Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, died after mostly purifying the surge of forbidden knowledge that contaminated Irminsul and creating her successor, Lesser Lord Kusanali, from the tree's purest branch.[16]\nMondstadt's Knights of Favonius, then led by Grand Master Arundolyn, led an expedition into Khaenri'ah to quell the monsters. His best friend and rival, Rostam, fell in battle during the cataclysm, leaving Arundolyn greatly bereaved. Other notable figures who are known for fighting against the monsters include Viridescent and the Crimson Witch of Flames. While the initial surge of monsters was eventually suppressed, hilichurls continue to spawn throughout Teyvat.\nIn the present, Khaenri'ah continues its struggle against the effects of the curse. Kaeya, their \"last hope,\" was sent to Mondstadt for the sake of an \"ancient plot,\" infiltrating the Ragnvindr Clan by being abandoned at the Dawn Winery.[17][18] The ultimate reason behind Kaeya being placed as a \"sleeper\" in Mondstadt by forces from Khaenri'ah is unknown.\nThe Abyss Order originates from the destruction of Khaenri'ah by the gods;[8] it seeks to destroy the countries under the protection of The Seven in revenge.[19] The people of Khaenri'ah turned into the monsters of the Abyss.[20] Thus, it is thought that Abyss Mages, Abyss Heralds, and Abyss Lectors were once people from Khaenri'ah, possibly its aristocracy and knights.\nThe Art of Khemia is an advanced type of alchemy developed in Khaenri'ah which allows for the creation of life itself.[21] Five hundred years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major contributing factor behind the cataclysm and the fall of Khaenri'ah.[9][22]\nThe only known practitioners of the Art of Khemia are Rhinedottir and Albedo, her student and successful attempt to create a synthetic human.\nRuin Machines were made as weapons of war by the people of Khaenri'ah. The most common type, Ruin Guards, were code-named \"Field Tillers\" by the people of Khaenri'ah. After the nation's downfall, the machines migrated across Teyvat. Though they are dangerous, they now lack any planned purpose.[8]\nThe people of Khaenri'ah, who were not \"pure-blooded,\" were changed into creatures of the Abyss as a result of the curse, which took place after Celestia destroyed their kingdom. However, \"pure-blooded\" Khaenri'ahns were, instead, given the curse of immortality by Ronova, preventing them from aging, but still suffering from apparent erosion. The others, who hailed from the lands of the gods, were, instead, punished with the \"curse of the wilderness\" and transformed into various creatures; the majority of them turned into hilichurls, but others, rather, appeared to turn into Abyss Mages, Heralds, or Lectors. The royal guards of Khaenri'ah, The Black Serpents, were instead eroded into either Shadowy Husks or still remained as the Black Serpents, but with a different form and still sharing the fate of suffering from erosion. However, the erosion was not complete, as some hilichurls were aware of the powers of a fountain in The Chasm and went there to \"die\" peacefully, while Halfdan and his subordinates remembered their duties to protect the people of Khaenri'ah.[20][23]\nKaeya's family, the Alberich Clan, were the Regents of Khaenri'ah after the cataclysm. It is unclear how many generations passed between Kaeya and the cataclysm; it is also unclear why Kaeya is unaffected by the curse.\nOther persons associated with the state include Pierro, Capitano,[24][25] Rhinedottir, and possibly Albedo and Arlecchino by extension.\n2 Characters match the category selection:\n1 Character matches the category selection:\nThere are 1 NPCs who appear in Khaenri'ah:\nThere are 5 additional NPCs related to Khaenri'ah:\nThere are 10 mentioned characters related to Khaenri'ah:\nThere are no upcoming NPCs related to Khaenri'ah."

    "summary": "Claymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nWeapon TypesGame Systems\nClaymores are one of the five weapon types that characters can use in Genshin Impact.\nClaymores restrict the character wielding them to slower hits than other melee weapons like Swords and Polearms, but deal more damage per hit with higher interruption capabilities. Due to being considered Blunt Attacks, Claymore attacks deal increased damage to Geo objects and certain Shields, and can trigger Shatter on Frozen enemies.\nA Claymore user's Normal Attack chain typically consists of 3–5 slow, but powerful and wide, melee attacks.\nA Claymore user's Charged Attack has a small windup before performing a rapid chain of attack that continuously drains their stamina. This attack will end with a more powerful slash if the attack button is released, if the character runs out of stamina, or if the max duration is reached. Notable exceptions include:\nWhen initiating a Charged Attack sequence from a standstill, Claymore users will cut short the animation of their first Normal Attack and transition it into the Charged Attack windup animation. However, if the first Normal Attack's Attack Speed is too fast, the character will finish performing the first Normal Attack before starting the Charged Attack windup. For example, Sayu who can normally directly enter a Charged Attack sequence from standstill, when at 150% Attack Speed, will have to perform her first Normal Attack before a Charged Attack sequence.\nTwo iterations of Claymore Charged Attack exist: a spinning attack for the short and medium-height characters and a continuous slash attack for the tall characters, except for Kaveh and Navia, who use the spinning iteration. However, they are functionally the same.\nTypically, Claymore Charged Attacks cost 40 Stamina per second and can last up to 5 seconds. Exceptions include Arataki Itto's Charged Attack, which costs 20 Stamina with no Superlative Superstrength stacks and 0 with any number of stacks, and both Kinich's and Mavuika's Charged Attacks, which costs 50 Stamina.\nClaymore Plunging Attacks are considered Blunt Attacks. All Claymore users have similar animations when plunging, which involves them performing a slash downward with their sword.\n17 Characters match the category selection:\nNo Characters match the category selection.\n39 Weapons match the category selection:\n1 Artifact Set matches the category selection:\nThere are 1 Talents that match the category selection:"

Notable exceptions include:\nSword Charged Attacks can only be performed after a Normal Attack, and cannot be buffered after the final Normal Attack in a combo. The only exception to this is Furina's Charged Attack.\nMost Sword users move forward during their Charged Attacks. However, exceptions are Keqing, Kaeya, Albedo, Chiori, and Xilonen who move backward, as well as Ayaka, Nilou and Furina, who do not move or have very little movement.\nSword Charged Attacks typically cost 20 Stamina, with the only exception being Keqing's which costs 25 Stamina.\nSword Plunging Attacks are considered Blunt Attacks.

As they cost 2,000 Mora each (70,000 Mora total for 35 artifacts per week) and amount to a total of 29,400 EXP, buying artifacts from shops provides 70% more EXP per Original Resin (assuming the equivalent of 23.33 Resin spent to get 70,000 Mora from Blossoms of Wealth) than domain runs."

    "summary": "The Seven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBase\nCelestia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seven Archons, typically shortened to The Seven,[1] are the seven gods who preside over the seven regions of Teyvat, established after they or their predecessors emerged as the victors of the Archon War 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.\nEach Archon possesses a magic focus called a Gnosis, which allows them to resonate directly with Celestia.[2] By comparison, Visions are \"primitive\" — though a Gnosis's capabilities and purpose, beyond acting as a symbol of an Archon's status, remain unknown. Each Archon is bound to a Divine Throne, which is composed of the Elemental Authority of one of the Seven Sovereigns, and which grants them authority over the corresponding element.[3]\nAs of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty, only six Divine Thrones remain. The Hydro Archon's Divine Throne was destroyed, returning the Authority within to the Hydro Dragon Sovereign and breaking the established order of the Seven.[3]\nThe Archon War began an indeterminate time in the past, and ended around 2,000 years ago. During this period of time, many gods and archons roamed the land, locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. It appears that the battles associated with the Archon War are a multitude of local struggles that were grouped together by human history. For example, Barbatos became the first Anemo Archon among The Seven after the death of Decarabian 2,600 years ago,[4] while Morax is implied to have already become Geo Archon by the time the last of the original Seven claimed their title and thus brought an end to the War.[5]\nThe original Seven appeared to be relatively close, sharing a common duty of guiding humanity and often gathering in Liyue for drinks. However, over time, five of The Seven passed away, and some of the newer Archons no longer adhered to the duty of guiding humanity.[5]\n500 years ago, the destruction of Khaenri'ah led to forbidden knowledge pollution and the rampage of Rhinedottir's creations, which held the power of the Abyss and ravaged the world of Teyvat.[6] Among those who were perished in the ensuing conflicts were Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, Raiden Makoto, and Egeria. They were subsequently replaced by Lesser Lord Kusanali, Raiden Ei, and Focalors, respectively. The Tsaritsa was also greatly affected by the cataclysm, resulting in a drastic change in her personality.\nThe Seven were summoned to Tunigi Hollow, where the worst outpouring of forbidden knowledge and monsters was occurring. During the battle, Egeria was killed and her body turned into the pool of water known as the Amrita.[7] To preserve the water's purity and tether the god to the mortal realm, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm — which serves as a seal over the dark hollow and prevents the corruption from spreading further — from the Amrita.[8] The Oceanids, who served the former Hydro Archon but did not get along with Focalors,[9] made their way to the Harvisptokhm in search of their master. Seeing that her current state was not what they had hoped for,[10] they spread all over the continent and world itself.[11]\nDuring this time, the Traveler and their sibling descended on Teyvat and, seeing the chaos, attempted to leave this world, only to run afoul of the Unknown God. While the twins did not meet The Seven during this time, The Seven are aware of them and have been awaiting the Traveler's arrival.[12]\nAround 400 years ago,[13] Ei completed her research into creating a lifelike puppet, the Shogun, to enforce her vision of Eternity over Inazuma while she retreated to the Plane of Euthymia.[14] Ever since then, the Shogun has been ruling Inazuma in her stead. Though Ei failed to make her puppets compatible with the Gnosis and thus gave it to Yae Miko instead, the Shogun is capable of tremendous feats even without it.\nAn Archon's source of power has been attributed to three sources: the first is through presiding over their respective region,[1] the second is from their people's faith in them and the third being one the Elemental Authorities stolen by the Heavenly Principles from the Seven Sovereigns.[15] Barbatos, who refuses to govern Mondstadt directly and had left Mondstadt for extended periods of time in the past, claims to be the weakest of The Seven as a result; however, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was imprisoned in the Sanctuary of Surasthana and shunned by the sages since she was born 500 years ago, explains that her fighting skills are inferior to the Traveler's because she does not hold her people's faith.\nThe Seven appear to be privy to information that mortals are generally unaware of or deem to be merely fictional. Venti, Zhongli and Mavuika are aware of the existences of other worlds, as well as the fact that the Traveler had the power to travel between different worlds.\nEach Archon presides over their respective element and have used it to shape the landscape and climate of their respective territories. This ability seems to be held by any god and not only The Seven, but ever since the end of the Archon War, there have only been seven Archons at a time.\nUnlike humans, who rely on resonance with a Vision to use the elements, the Archons seen so far were already affiliated with their elements before becoming Archons: Barbatos was originally a wind spirit who ascended to godhood, historical records regarding Morax address him as the \"God of Geo\" long before he became the Geo Archon, and Ei (and by proxy, Makoto) is an \"incarnation of lightning.\"[16] Incarnations of Irminsul, i.e. Rukkhadevata and Nahida, are appointed guardians and maintainers of the tree of Irminsul. Nahida was created using a branch of Irminsul, confirming the connection between Irminsul and Dendro. Focalors (and by extension, Furina) was an Oceanid who was transformed into a human by Egeria using the power of the Primordial Sea, though Furina has since been converted into a full human. An Oceanid legend says that Egeria herself was created by the Shade of Life to take the place of \"the Primordial Sea's Heart\" after the Hydro Dragon was \"removed from that role.\" After the victory against Xiuhcoatl, the Pyro Sovereign, the first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque, bargained with the Ruler of Death, Ronova, to borrow her power to establish the rules that would aid Natlan's fight against the Abyss — the Ode of Resurrection and the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.[17] He also set up the systems and rules that would allow future mortals to ascend to Pyro Archonhood.[18]\nWhile people on Teyvat commonly believe that the Archons grant Visions,[19] they actually have no control over the distribution of Visions and are largely unaware of circumstances surrounding Visions.[20] However, within her Plane of Euthymia, Ei could enact the \"Vision Hunt Decree\" effect to seal all characters' Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts besides the Traveler's.[21] Because the Plane of Euthymia is Ei's personal dimension, there is not enough information to determine how this effect works or whether Ei is capable of enacting this anywhere else.\nWhile gnoses are described as being emblematic of an Archon's status and give them a direct connection to Celestia, their exact purpose and abilities remain a mystery. They evidently grant Archons a large power boost and the \"divine ability\" to defend their nations,[22] and Zhongli attributes the ability to mint Mora as something that \"requires the use of the Geo Archon's power.\"[23] The use of the gnoses' power is not exclusive to its respective Archon, as Nahida also utilized the power of the Electro Gnosis to aid in the healing of Irminsul. When Mavuika first ascended to Pyro Archon, it is implied that she threw away the vision she had as the Sacred Flame granted her significant knowledge and memory of Natlan.[24]\nEach Divine Throne is composed of one of the Elemental Authorities stolen from the Seven Sovereigns by the Heavenly Principles, and it is the Throne that grants each Archon their authority over the corresponding element, though what exactly this entails remains yet unknown. A great amount of power is required to destroy the Throne, and its destruction, resulting in the death of the Archon bound to the Throne, appears to be the only way to return the Authority contained within to the Sovereign.[3]\nOn multiple occasions, Archons have fashioned humanoid vessels using their powers as an Archon, perhaps through the use of their Gnoses. Venti's vessel was his first use of his newfound divine power after ascending to godhood as the Anemo Archon.[25] Zhongli's body was likely created through this method as well, as he states that his \"structure is not the same as that of normal people.\"[26] After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto \"reforged\" Ei's body after Ei gave up her bodily form so Makoto could ascend to the \"heavenly citadel.\"[27]\nAlthough gods are immortal, their physical vessels — including those made with the power of an Archon — have finite lifespans and can be \"killed,\" while their consciousness can fade away.[28] By the time of the main story, five of the original Seven have died and been replaced. While pondering how she would overcome her physical lifespan, Ei stumbled on a method of creating synthetic puppets indistinguishable from true life, which she used to create Scaramouche and the Shogun. After giving her Gnosis to Yae Miko for safekeeping, Ei discarded her physical form, the Shogun warning her that there was no return from giving up her body.[29] Due to no longer having a physical body, Ei is only able to manifest herself outside of her Plane of Euthymia by using the body of the puppet as her own.[30]\nVessels created through an Archon's power have another major weakness: they are incapable of being healed through ordinary means, including a Vision-bearer's healing abilities.[2] Venti harnesses the power of the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero twice to heal himself; first was to expunge the abyssal magic that poisoned him via Dvalin when the Traveler unintentionally interrupted them,[31] and the second was to recover after having his Gnosis taken by Signora.[2] The exact properties this tree holds is unclear, but it may have a connection to Celestia: according to legend, it grew from the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia.\nIn case of Pyro Archon, a mortal can ascend to godhood after winning the position through the Pilgrimage. As Pyro Archons are still mortals who age and die like regular humans, Natlan has had many Pyro Archons in the past. When a new Pyro Archon ascends to the Divine Throne, their \"inner flame\" will awaken, and the Sacred Flame grants them significant knowledge and memory of this land.[18]\nIt's important to note that vessels can be the Archons themselves and not different entities. This page specifically refers to a human body created by Archons to live among the people of Teyvat as vessel creation is not exclusive to the Archons, in fact most gods are capable of this feat.\nSome members of The Seven have worked through proxies who were not Archons but appeared to be so to the people of Teyvat. These include the following characters:"

    "summary": "Fatui\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestar Banner\n\n\nLeader(s)\nThe TsaritsaEleven Fatui Harbingers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFound­er(s)\nThe TsaritsaPierro\n\n\nBase\nZapolyarny Palace, Snezhnaya\n\n\nRegion\nSnezhnaya\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fatui also called the Warriors of the Pale Star are a delegation of diplomats from the Zapolyarny Palace of Snezhnaya. There is also a military detachment led by the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and the Tsaritsa herself. They are one of the two main antagonistic factions alongside the Abyss Order in Genshin Impact and the main antagonists in the official supplementary manga.\nA singular member of the Fatui is called a Fatuus.\nThe Fatui are a powerful military force in terms of power and numbers, making it the strongest of all the seven nations. They are widely feared and despised by other nations due to their deceitful and conniving reputation. The organization is composed of members performing a variety of roles, including combatants, bureaucrats, politicians, and merchants.\nHailing from the frozen lands of Snezhnaya, the Fatui are publicly seen as a political department of the nation that represents the goodwill of the Tsaritsa and manages foreign affairs with all six other nations. However, despite how they initially present themselves, the citizens and governments of those nations are often already aware of their true colors, and treat both their diplomats and individual members of the organization with distrust.\nThey often use underhanded methods to establish their power and influence in another nation, and as a whole are willing to go to extremes to further the Tsaritsa's vision for a \"perfect world.\" Deception, extortion,[1] and human experimentation are but some of the tactics they employ to bolster their own strength.\nDespite their loyalty to their empress, most of the Fatui grunts themselves are unaware of the Tsaritsa's true plans. The Harbingers are likely some of the few among the ranks who are truly aware of the Tsaritsa's true intentions, as they are the ones assisting her in collecting Gnoses.\nThe Fatui are divided into divisions, each of which is headed by one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Each Harbinger operates with a different modus operandi which also influences how their underlings act.[2] There is often a lack of thorough communication between fellow Harbingers,[3][4] Harbingers and their subordinates, as well as between different divisions of Fatui operatives.[5] However, some members of the Fatui are quite loyal to their leading Harbinger, to the point of being willing to seek revenge for their sake.[6]\nThe Fatui come from a variety of backgrounds: some were taken in at the House of the Hearth orphanage,[7][8] others choose to join their ranks, while others, like Childe, can be enlisted by their parents. They also do not hesitate to help financially and diplomatically strategic allies in order to interfere in foreign policy.[9]\nThey receive certain advantages in exchange for their services, such as supplies, salaries, or powerful weapons;[10] in exchange for this, however, they choose neither the destination to which they are sent, nor the superiors to whom they obey.[11]\nMany of the Fatui NPCs in the game are everyday workers who are oblivious to their superiors' true intentions, but are nevertheless very loyal to the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya. Members have differing opinions on being stationed in other nations, ranging from intense homesickness[12] to having developed fondness for their new home.[13]\nSo far, the Fatui's tactic to increase their influence in Mondstadt has been to incite or take advantage of disturbances to offer their assistance in a way that puts the Knights of Favonius in an awkward position. For example, they provoked Ursa the Drake into attacking the city so that Il Dottore could defeat it (later attempting a similar setup during Ludi Harpastum),[14] and one of their diplomats pressured Jean to allow them to kill Dvalin after the Stormterror attack.[15] Later during the Stormterror conflict, agents stole the Holy Lyre der Himmel, though it was soon recovered. A delegation of diplomats is currently residing in the Goth Grand Hotel, though they are apparently under lockdown.[5] During Eula's Story Quest, it is revealed that some members were colluding with Schubert Lawrence to invade Mondstadt, promising to help him establish the Lawrence Clan as the rulers of the city once again, though this plot was quickly foiled by the Knights of Favonius.[16]\nThe Fatui were presumably the ones who gave Crepus his Delusion, and were the ones who lured Ursa the Drake to his carriage, eventually leading to his death. They are also competing with Diluc to find a vial that contains the Anemo Archon's breath, which was stolen six months prior to the events of the game from one of the Temples of the Four Winds. Due to the amount of counterfeits that have flooded the market since, both the Fatui and Diluc have yet to find the real one, though Diluc has been purchasing every counterfeit he can find just in case.[17]\nThe Fatui also have plans involving the heart of the deceased Abyssal dragon, Durin, in Dragonspine, though the Traveler ends up interfering when they arrive.[18]\nThe Fatui used to have some kind of diplomatic immunity in Liyue Harbor (and an embassy),[19] and have been investing in the local economy through the Northland Bank, though the Liyue Qixing are wary of them. The Northland Bank is an arm of the Fatui \"with some exceptions\"[20] despite their receptionist Ekaterina denying this, being a national bank founded in Snezhnaya that has opened a branch in Liyue Harbor. The Harbingers are important clients of the bank, and the Fatui's Debt Collection division, of which Fatui Pyro Agents are a part, seem to assist the bank in tracking down debtors.[21] The Fatui also have ties to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor,[22] the exact nature of which are unclear.\nA Fatuus agent named Javert would make contact with Gentry Maocai in order to obtain large amounts of Cor Lapis, giving him some thugs to help force merchants into selling their stockpile lower than the market price. Gentry would later attempt to strongarm Chang the Ninth of his stockpile, but the Traveler and Xingqiu put a stop to Gentry's antics. Javert, realizing that he was outmatched and that Maocai wouldn't honor the contract, left, threatening the merchant of the payment. Gentry would be forced to buy the stockpile at triple the market price and likely delivered the needed materials to Javert afterwards.[23]\nShortly after The Chasm shut down due to a series of mysterious incidents, the Harbinger Signora had negotiated with the Qixing to allow the Fatui's Ninth Company to enter the underground mines to cleanse the mysterious sludge in the mines with an experimental device. The Fatui would investigate The Chasm, while the Millelith would deliver supplies and orders. However, the device exploded and the Fatui became scattered across the mines. The Ninth Company, a group of 64 soldiers, suffered such immense casualties from this that half of the men are assumed dead or missing including the company captain, forcing Staff Sergeant Anton to assume command, although not everyone has listened to him. By the time the Traveler discovers them, Anton has three soldiers remaining under his command. Begging them for help, Anton and his men learn what happened and decide to retreat.[24]\nFatui soldiers assisted Childe after he summoned the Overlord of the Vortex in order to draw out Rex Lapis, fighting against the Traveler, Keqing, and the Millelith on the Jade Chamber. Since this was effectively abetting a plot to destroy Liyue Harbor, this caused the remaining Fatui in Liyue to be looked down upon with suspicion and the Ninth Company in the Chasm was promptly abandoned and declared criminals by the Millelith, having lost all communication with the surface and desperately running low on rations, with some scattered groups bartering with Treasure Hoarders in the region for food.[25] Katarina is another notable Fatuus, having remained in the underground mines to search for her brother, who was separated from her.\nWhile relations have soured since Childe's actions, the Fatui still has a delegation in Liyue and is still interested in the nation's politics — upon learning that Uncle Tian had wanted to step down from the Liyue Qixing, they colluded with one of his disciples, Zhiyi, to assassinate and replace him so they could have influence over the Liyue Qixing. Fortunately, this plot was foiled by Yelan, who had been investigating Zhiyi, although the Harbinger Pantalone (who was monitoring Liyue's situation) managed to minimize the Liyue Qixing's advantage over the Fatui.[9]\nThe Fatui were the masterminds behind the Vision Hunt Decree in Inazuma, and fanned the flames of conflict on both sides of the Inazuman civil war. They colluded with the Tenryou and Kanjou Commissions to feed the Raiden Shogun false information[26] and gather materials for their Delusion Factory respectively, secretly distributed Delusions among the Watatsumi resistance forces, and planted spies throughout the country in various efforts to destabilize both Watatsumi and the Shogunate and render them vulnerable to Fatui influence.[27][28] They caused the Tatarasuna Incident by sabotaging the Mikage Furnace as part of Pierro's plan to lay the groundwork for a future endeavor in Inazuma; while unconfirmed, it was most likely the prelude to the Vision Hunt Decree plot. They were also responsible for the Tatarigami outbreak on Yashiori Island, as a Fatui infiltrator convinced members of the Watatsumi Army to destroy the wards on Yashiori Island.[28][29]\nUpon revealing the truth to the Raiden Shogun and demanding a duel before the throne, the Traveler prevails against Signora; as a consequence of losing the duel, the Shogun executed Signora with the Musou no Hitotachi. The Traveler later spends time with Ei after revealing that her Vision Hunt Decree was wrong, ending the civil war. She discovers the Fatui's involvement in Inazuma's policies and expels them as a friendly party.\nCapitano dispatched Naval Warrant Officer Borenka to cover up the Fatui's involvement in the Yashiori Island disaster by recovering the infiltrator's report and extracting any Inazuman recruits to be silenced. However, he and his group were defeated by the Traveler and Shizuru, who retrieved the report for Watatsumi.[28] Some of Signora's subordinates have stayed behind to avenge her, seeking to disrupt the peace treaty between the Shogunate and Watatsumi, though they were unsuccessful.[6] Another group from the House of the Hearth, led by Efim Snezhevich, also planned to reignite the civil war by poisoning Watatsumi Island; Efim believes this would raise the prestige of their patron, the Harbinger Arlecchino,[7] though it is later revealed that he had broken off with unsuspecting subordinates to advance the previous Knave's directives. This plan was disrupted by the defection of Lyudochka Snezhevna, and the Shuumatsuban is working to root out Efim's remaining associates.[30]\nFatui involvement in Sumeru has largely been from the Harbinger Il Dottore's projects. They collaborated with the sages of Sumeru Akademiya to replace Lesser Lord Kusanali with a new god of wisdom. Dottore was aware that the sages did not acknowledge Kusanali as a successor to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and he was intrigued by the possibility of creating an artificial god. He set up an experiment to turn the Harbinger Scaramouche into Sumeru's new god using the Electro Gnosis (previously acquired by Scaramouche). They successfully turned Scaramouche into the god Shouki no Kami, the Prodigal, though he was soon defeated and Lesser Lord Kusanali was restored as the deity of Sumeru. In the aftermath, Dottore recovered the Electro and Dendro Gnoses for the Tsaritsa via a deal with Lesser Lord Kusanali: the deletion of all his other Segments, as well as an exchange of information.\nFollowing these events, Lesser Lord Kusanali took Scaramouche under her wing. Upon learning the truth and scale of Dottore's machinations, he broke off from the Fatui and attempted to erase himself from Irminsul, though this attempt was unsuccessful. Upon restoring his memories via a backup that Kusanali had made to resist tampering, Scaramouche abandoned his name and the Fatui. As an effect of tampering with Irminsul, Scaramouche's seat would remain unoccupied for hundreds of years, with any further effects being unknown.[31]\nAnother of Il Dottore's projects involves weaponizing dreams and The Withering, and many of Dottore's subordinates in Dharma Forest have been tasked with aiding the project. Dottore is particularly interested in the Aranara, who possess the power to manipulate dreams, and his subordinates have been ordered to catch the Aranara for study. With the help of an infiltrator they have been trapping children from Vimara Village to lure out the Aranara, though such measures have consistently failed due to the Aranara's innate properties.[32] A related team led by Oleg set up research camps across the forest using machines with the goal of extracting energy from Withering Zones. However, the machines were not actually intended for that use and they had been tricked into using them by Kasim, a con artist. Oleg's team was eventually arrested by the Corps of Thirty and their machines were disabled.[33]\nUnder the guise of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament, another Fatuus named Elchingen would collaborate with dubious scholars from the Sumeru Akademiya, creating the Wisdom Orb in order to convince people to domesticate fungus for the tournament. The orb was also programmed to force control of the fungus, in the hopes that Elchingen could overthrow Sumeru with his army of fungus. The plot was foiled by the Traveler, Miko, Layla, Haniyyah and the Sumeran authorities. An unknown Fatui commander, deeming Elchingen to be too troublesome, ordered an agent named Yurochka to kill him, which he successfully did.[34]\nThe Fatui are also active throughout the Great Red Sand. They have been collaborating with Thutmose, an Eremite faction, in order to explore the ruins of King Deshret's civilization.[35] Separately, the Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team was sent to the Desert of Hadramaveth to study the desert tribes[36] and explore the Eternal Oasis, striking a deal with the Tanit tribe for aid. However, they were betrayed by Matriarch Babel, putting their efforts at a standstill. When Babel ordered Jeht to eliminate the Traveler, she refused the order, prompting her to lay a trap with the Fatui to eliminate her. The Fatui successfully caught her, but were terrified of her tenacity. Likewise, she told the Traveler of her \"betrayal\", hoping that one of them would kill the other, but the plan was foiled and the two destroyed the team.\nSome Fatui were also sent to the Girdle of the Sands for reasons unknown, with one officer, Markozov, seeking the Pari for unknown reasons related to knowledge, though Sosi believes that they were coveting the power of the gods. Markozov's group was driven off by the Traveler.\nThe Harbinger Arlecchino is the Father of the House of Hearth in Fontaine, and as such she is concerned by a prophecy claiming that the people of Fontaine will one day dissolve into the water of the Primordial Sea, leaving only the Archon Focalors to weep. Arlecchino and her operatives under the House of the Hearth were in Fontaine for the supposed reason of stopping the prophecy from occurring. Tartaglia was also sent to Fontaine to assist the Northland Bank branch there, but was (falsely) accused of being the perpetrator behind a series of mysterious disappearances. Though he was proven innocent, the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale still declared him guilty, and he was sentenced to the Fortress of Meropide. Arlecchino sent several of her agents to infiltrate Meropide and gather intel, though many of them were captured by Wriothesley. She also took it to herself to investigate the true identity of the Hydro Archon.\nThe Fatui are also involved in other operations throughout the nation. Henri was hired by the Fatui to collect parts from the Fontaine Research Institute for them, and was misled into extracting the cores of seven water quality monitor devices, being told they were polluting the water. The Traveler helped him, not knowing he was hired by the Fatui. However, Henri's boss was ultimately captured by Hunter and Turner, who revealed Henri had been tricked.[37]\nThe 34th Independent Investigative Squad was deployed to Mont Esus East, and took over several hydrological monitoring stations once used by the Fontaine Research Institute, claiming the Maison Gestion gave them permission. In truth, they were only pretending to work, as the squad (including its captain Malinovskyi) simply wanted to slack off but were being monitored by the deputy captain, Shumilov, who they did not like. In the end they were chased off by the Traveler, who was helping the researcher Broglie.[38]\nFollowing an explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute, Arlecchino sent several of her Fatui Operatives to investigate the matter. It is also implied that they entered a partnership with Edwin Eastinghouse and Nacker regarding Arkhium, as a Wind Operative can be found in Nacker's former laboratory in the Morte Region following his capture.\nUpon learning of some ancient ruins near Poisson, Arlecchino had sent a group out to explore it, but they soon learned of the Poisson disaster and devoted their resources to helping the people out, such as performing headcounts and monitoring water levels. When Lyney, Lynette and Freminet learned of the Traveler and Neuvillette's plan to \"trap\" Furina so she could admit her secrets, Lyney had the Fatui help him in replicating a larger-scale version of the trick he initially performed at the Opera Epiclese, who created a false house and made a tunnel from Poisson all the way to the opera house. They also assisted Freminet in finding a missing stone slate that the Traveler, Neuvillette and Navia had come upon while investigating the ruins.\nWhen the prophecy passed, Neuvillette gave Arlecchino the Hydro Gnosis as a \"diplomatic gift\", as both Arlecchino and Tartaglia provided invaluable assistance to the people of Fontaine and that he wanted to dispose of it after Skirk's urging. Arlecchino's role in acquiring the Gnosis would result in Pulcinella and Pantalone placing her and her organization in the spotlight of Project Stuzha, however she and her members suspected their sudden thrust into the spotlight was meant to keep them in check.[39]\nThe forces of another Harbinger (likely Sandrone) worked with a civilian named Jenck to steal Sir Arthur to help him take over The Steambird in return for finding Mosso Lombroso's inheritance and research in machine intelligence. The collaboration ended when Jenck destroyed \"Curve\", a lie-detecting Clockwork Meka created by Lombroso, and most of his research to avoid capture, so the Harbinger had him punished accordingly by breaking his mind and ripping his tongue out, leaving a letter apologizing to the Traveler, Paimon and Talochard. The Harbinger's subordinates were ordered to recover Curve's remains afterwards before anyone could act.[40]\nAfter giving the Gnosis to the Tsaritsa, Arlecchino returned to Fontaine and had a meeting with Neuvillette, where she gave him a proposal of her own. While he was initially hesitant to accept at first, upon learning the entire deal, he accepted the offer. Arlecchino proposed to him that there were members from the House who wanted to leave, but did not want to be targeted due to their secrets. In return for having their memories of the House erased and allowing them to live normal lives in Fontaine, Arlecchino would withdraw the majority of her forces from Fontaine and would not carry out any \"special missions\" in the nation unless absolutely necessary.[41]\nA newly certified agent would later arrive at Petrichor in order to collect a debt from Giulietta, who had defaulted on a debt regarding flute-making materials. When they arrived, another Fontanian, Giustino, hired them to bring him back to Petrichor, though upon arriving, the agent ambushed him, believing him to be the person owing the debt. After being beaten by the Traveler, the agent, who had been too enthusiastic with his first job, realized that he had targeted wrong person, as his main target was now in Bayda Harbor. He quickly left in a hurry in order to pursue her and collect the debt.[42]\nDuring Varka's expedition with the veteran members of the Knights of Favonius, they ran into Il Capitano and his subordinates, who were heading to Natlan. They eventually arrived, and Neuvillette states that Il Capitano had \"thrown himself\" into the nation's endless \"wars\". Capitano later confronted the Pyro Archon, Mavuika, over her indecision and failure to fulfill the oath made 500 years ago. In the ensuing duel, Mavuika managed to injure Capitano, who was able to retreat due to Ororon's assistance. Acknowledging his defeat to her and learning that she had spent her powers fighting him, he refrained from stealing the Gnosis and informed the Tsaritsa that he would abandon his task, which she accepted.\nGroups of Fatui were also sent across Natlan's plains. A group of Fatui were stationed in Coatepec Mountain, capturing the local Saurians under Capitano's orders to experiment on them regarding Phlogiston. The \"Polychrome Tri-Stars,\" a trio of prominent Fatui footsoldiers, were also sent to assist in maintaining the machine, though they would eventually wander to Huitztli Hill for reasons unknown. The Traveler discovered the facility and shut it down, freeing the captured Saurians in the process.\nAfter Capitano failed to acquire the Gnosis from Mavuika, he ordered his subordinates to instead focus on an alternate plan to rework the nation's Ley Lines by searching for the Source Mechanism. He also sent a request to be relieved of his duties of acquiring the Gnosis, which the Tsaritsa approved. Having interrogated three scholars and combining their research, they were able to locate the device and headed to a cave to activate it. The plan instead failed, as it awakened Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night, and creator of the Night Kingdom. As a result of the failed plan, Ororon became acknowledged as one of the six heroes for Mavuika's plan, and Capitano eventually agreed to support Mavuika, knowing that her plan had the potential for the best outcome. Thus, he ordered his subordinates to begin assisting the Natlanese, knowing that they would not defy him.[43]\nWhen the Abyss launched a massive invasion on Natlan, the Fatui worked with the Natlanese to fight the invasion off, suffering immense casualties in the process.[44] Nonetheless, after the battle concluded, Mavuika thanked Capitano for their invaluable assistance.[45] Upon learning of the False Sky after the invasion, Dottore also sent a small group of Fatui to infiltrate Natlan from Nod-Krai to investigate the Ancient Moon Remnants.[46]\nOnce the Abyss influence was purged from the Night Kingdom, Capitano merged his life force with Lord of the Night's, seating himself at the Throne of the Primal Fire as his consciousness was moved to the Night Kingdom to substitute Mavuika's sacrifice to Ronova. The Tsaritsa retained Capitano's status as a Harbinger. Aware of her plans with the Gnoses, Mavuika suspected that the Tsaritsa would send another Harbinger to collect the Gnosis.\nA group of Fatui led by Grudoc, who were affiliated with Pantalone, were sent to accompany a Fontanian merchant named Montluson to the Masters of the Night-Wind in order to search for evidence of the Battle of Seven Colors, as Montluson had created a special paint and was enraged when his profits failed to materialize, after a Fontanian tourist claimed to have seen the same color in Natlan. Pantalone believed that Montluson had the potential to become a giant in the painting industry and disrupt Fontaine's economic system, which apparently aligned with his interests. While Citlali and the Traveler defeated the Fatui, Grudoc proceeded to use a backup plan by destroying the sphere to avoid implicating Pantalone in the plot, presumably at the cost of his own life.[47]\nAnother group of Fatui set up camp by the Great Volcano of Tollan to investigate the kuuvahki, requested by a specific Lord Harbinger. Some of these Fatui participated in a feast involving Bifrons's green mushrooms, cooking at their camp.[48]\nThe Fatui Harbingers were recently summoned back to Snezhnaya and dispatched to Nod-Krai, following the highest of commands the \"Palestar Edict.\"  According to Helka, they brought with them with many construction materials, though she does not know what they intend to do. [49][50]\nThe Tsaritsa is the Cryo Archon and the Archon presiding over Snezhnaya. The Fatui Harbingers carry out her plans to seize authority from the gods, though her motivations for doing this are still shrouded in mystery.\nThe Eleven Fatui Harbingers are the executive officers of the organization, being under only the Tsaritsa herself. They are given absolute executive authority by her and answer directly to her. They are blessed with powers that exceed those of an average human, but those powers do not seem to be derived from their Visions. Instead, the Harbingers all possess a Delusion, which are said to be even more powerful. Those among the Fatui who have proven themselves in their strength are chosen by one of them to serve as direct subordinates. Each Harbinger goes by a code name instead of their real names and leads their own division within the Fatui. Currently, the only known divisions are the Debt Collection division and the Intelligence division, the latter also being known as the House of the Hearth.\nAll of the names and aliases for the Harbingers who have not received in-game introductions can be found in the video description of the Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo.\nThe House of the Hearth is a group founded by Crucabena, who is succeeded by Arlecchino. Unlike the other known Fatui groups, all of its members consist of orphans from all over the continent who are raised under a single group. Once the orphans have come of age, they enlist in the Fatui and either continue to serve Arlecchino, or transfer to a different Harbinger's command.\nThere are 21 other characters who are (or were) part of the House of the Hearth:\nThis company was dispatched by Pulcinella to The Chasm: Underground Mines to investigate its recent strange phenomena as part of an agreement between Snezhnaya and the Liyue Qixing. After Tartaglia's actions in Liyue Harbor, this arrangement was nullified and the supply chains were cut off, but the company stayed, unaware of the events at the surface.\nThe company originally contained 64 members, but Anton estimates that half of the soldiers have gone missing or died to accidents within the Chasm. Since the company's captain had also gone missing, Anton declared himself as the Brevet Captain (acting commanding officer).\nIts members included:\nThe Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team was sent to the Desert of Hadramaveth to investigate the status of the desert tribes for Dottore[36] as well as explore the Eternal Oasis venerated by the Eremites. The expedition commander, Professor Froderock Fronkonsteen, also wished to obtain a member of the desert tribes for experimentation.[62] They struck a deal with the Tanit tribe; they would supply the Tanit with Snezhnayan supplies and technical documents and help Babel consolidate power in exchange for the tribe's help exploring the oasis. However, Babel betrayed them, resulting in the Fatui becoming scattered and unable to advance.[62] They briefly work with Aderfi and Azariq to overthrow Babel, but this fails after the Traveler and Jeht kill the two \"traitors.\"\nEventually, the expedition team ends their negotiations with the Tanit with a deal to get rid of Jeht, who would be taken as their test subject. They capture Jeht and take her to their ad-hoc headquarters at Wadi Al-Majuj to be transported out of the desert. Jeht ultimately breaks free and slaughters her way through the camp, likely killing Professor Fronkensteen as well.[63]\nIts members included:\nThis unit was dispatched to Fontaine, though they are not actually following any orders and are just pretending to investigate the Fontaine Research Institute to appease their strict deputy captain.\nIts members include:"

During this time, monsters created by the alchemist Rhinedottir, also known as \"Gold,\" poured out from Khaenri'ah to invade Teyvat, and Khaenri'ah was eventually destroyed by Celestia and the gods. Afterwards, all Khaenri'ahns who were not \"pure-blooded\" were turned into monsters, whereas all \"pure-blooded\" Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality.[4]\nDespite its destruction and the transformation of many of its people into monsters, some Khaenri'ahns are still wandering through Teyvat. Dainsleif — a denizen of Khaenri'ah and the narrator of Travail — describes it as one of \"the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall,\" and says that its people \"dream of dreaming,\" unlike the majority who are \"content to live, and not to dream.\"[5]\nAccording to Kaeya, it is said that Khaenri'ah is located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru.[6] The Khaenri'ahn installation known as Hangeh Afrasiyab guards a giant, tightly sealed stone gate beneath it that most likely leads to Khaenri'ah.[7]\nArchon Quest Chapter ?? takes place in this region.\nKhaenri'ah is deep underground and is mostly barren of natural life. What is currently known about Khaenri'ah largely comes from weapon and artifact descriptions, as well as books found throughout the world. According to Dainsleif, it is the \"pride of humanity\", as it was built purely by humans without involvement from any god, but it was later destroyed by the gods.[8]\nThe practice of the Art of Khemia[9] and the use of forbidden knowledge[10] led to the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah's ruin. Around 500 years ago, King Irmin introduced forbidden knowledge to enhance the kingdom's technological advancement. The alchemist Rhinedottir also used it in her experiments to develop powerful creatures containing the power of the Abyss, including Durin, Elynas, and the Riftwolves. For some reason, these creatures began wreaking havoc throughout Khaenri'ah and then spread into the rest of Teyvat.[11]\nIn response,[12] the gods of Celestia and six of The Seven[13] launched an assault on Khaenri'ah. The skies turned red and filled with crimson cubes, (possibly the work of the Unknown God), and the landmass the kingdom was built on was torn to pieces, with lava flooding the shattered fragments of it.[14] While the gods were victorious, at least two of The Seven — the Hydro Archon Egeria and the Electro Archon Raiden Makoto[15] — were killed. A third Archon, the Dendro Archon Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, died after mostly purifying the surge of forbidden knowledge that contaminated Irminsul and creating her successor, Lesser Lord Kusanali, from the tree's purest branch.[16]\nMondstadt's Knights of Favonius, then led by Grand Master Arundolyn, led an expedition into Khaenri'ah to quell the monsters. His best friend and rival, Rostam, fell in battle during the cataclysm, leaving Arundolyn greatly bereaved. Other notable figures who are known for fighting against the monsters include Viridescent and the Crimson Witch of Flames. While the initial surge of monsters was eventually suppressed, hilichurls continue to spawn throughout Teyvat.\nIn the present, Khaenri'ah continues its struggle against the effects of the curse. Kaeya, their \"last hope,\" was sent to Mondstadt for the sake of an \"ancient plot,\" infiltrating the Ragnvindr Clan by being abandoned at the Dawn Winery.[17][18] The ultimate reason behind Kaeya being placed as a \"sleeper\" in Mondstadt by forces from Khaenri'ah is unknown.\nThe Abyss Order originates from the destruction of Khaenri'ah by the gods;[8] it seeks to destroy the countries under the protection of The Seven in revenge.[19] The people of Khaenri'ah turned into the monsters of the Abyss.[20] Thus, it is thought that Abyss Mages, Abyss Heralds, and Abyss Lectors were once people from Khaenri'ah, possibly its aristocracy and knights.\nThe Art of Khemia is an advanced type of alchemy developed in Khaenri'ah which allows for the creation of life itself.[21] Five hundred years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major contributing factor behind the cataclysm and the fall of Khaenri'ah.[9][22]\nThe only known practitioners of the Art of Khemia are Rhinedottir and Albedo, her student and successful attempt to create a synthetic human.\nRuin Machines were made as weapons of war by the people of Khaenri'ah. The most common type, Ruin Guards, were code-named \"Field Tillers\" by the people of Khaenri'ah. After the nation's downfall, the machines migrated across Teyvat. Though they are dangerous, they now lack any planned purpose.[8]\nThe people of Khaenri'ah, who were not \"pure-blooded,\" were changed into creatures of the Abyss as a result of the curse, which took place after Celestia destroyed their kingdom. However, \"pure-blooded\" Khaenri'ahns were, instead, given the curse of immortality by Ronova, preventing them from aging, but still suffering from apparent erosion. The others, who hailed from the lands of the gods, were, instead, punished with the \"curse of the wilderness\" and transformed into various creatures; the majority of them turned into hilichurls, but others, rather, appeared to turn into Abyss Mages, Heralds, or Lectors. The royal guards of Khaenri'ah, The Black Serpents, were instead eroded into either Shadowy Husks or still remained as the Black Serpents, but with a different form and still sharing the fate of suffering from erosion. However, the erosion was not complete, as some hilichurls were aware of the powers of a fountain in The Chasm and went there to \"die\" peacefully, while Halfdan and his subordinates remembered their duties to protect the people of Khaenri'ah.[20][23]\nKaeya's family, the Alberich Clan, were the Regents of Khaenri'ah after the cataclysm. It is unclear how many generations passed between Kaeya and the cataclysm; it is also unclear why Kaeya is unaffected by the curse.\nOther persons associated with the state include Pierro, Capitano,[24][25] Rhinedottir, and possibly Albedo and Arlecchino by extension.\n2 Characters match the category selection:\n1 Character matches the category selection:\nThere are 1 NPCs who appear in Khaenri'ah:\nThere are 5 additional NPCs related to Khaenri'ah:\nThere are 10 mentioned characters related to Khaenri'ah:\nThere are no upcoming NPCs related to Khaenri'ah."

    "summary": "Abyss Order\n\nLeader(s)\nTraveler's Sibling (‍PrincePrinceText for male Traveler/PrincessPrincessText for female Traveler‍)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetails\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFound­er(s)\nChlothar\n\n\nBase\nThe Abyss\nThe Abyss Order is a mysterious, powerful legion of monsters from the Abyss who are the enemies of both humanity and surface civilization, and thrive in many corners of Teyvat. They are one of the two primary antagonistic factions alongside the Fatui in Genshin Impact.\nThe Abyss Order was founded by Chlothar Alberich, a noble in the Alberich royal family. Some time after the cataclysm, he encountered a \"Sinner\" and was greatly awed by its power. He would then go on to establish the Abyss Order. In his ramblings, he addressed the Traveler's Sibling as the \"Prince/Princess\" of the Abyss Order, somehow aware that they would eventually become its leader.[1]\nThe Abyss Order's size, membership, hierarchy, and degree of power are unknown. Because most members reside in the Abyss, little is actually known about them by Teyvat, other than that they hold a strong hatred against the people of the seven nations and their Archons, and desire to overthrow the world ruled by the Archons. Many, if not all members were originally from Khaenri'ah prior to being cursed.\nMembers of the Abyss Order are generally perceived as any intelligent humanoid being, such as Abyss Lectors/Heralds and Iniquitous Baptists. It should be noted that not all of these beings are members of the Abyss Order, such as Jakob, a neohuman who takes the form of an Iniquitous Baptist (and shows disdain towards the organization), a Cryo Abyss Herald that the Traveler's sibling encountered before the Abyss Order was founded,[1] and an Electro Abyss Lector that Burkina fought during the cataclysm.[2]\nThere is an \"inner circle\" in the Order that is close to the Traveler's Sibling, though the purpose or members of this group is currently unknown.\nThe Loom of Fate is an ongoing operation that the Abyss Order is undertaking. The name was first used by Chlothar a few centuries prior to the events of the game to describe his son Caribert; he claimed that Caribert had become the \"Loom of Fate\" after being imbued with Abyssal power, and would be able to weave his destiny anew.[3] Before the Traveler arrived at Fontaine, the term refers to attempts by the Abyss Order to construct a mechanical god.[4]\nFollowing the destruction of the Divine Throne of Hydro, the Loom of Fate now refers to a powerful device that when fully operational, is able to weave its own Ley Lines into the planet. While incomplete it was able to weave new memories, a function Caribert used to calm the hilichurls around Vimara Village and implant false memories of him living with the village's inhabitants to enjoy the life that he was never able to live. Upon completion it lost this function. The Traveler's sibling is currently attempting to fully activate the device before the Heavenly Principles awaken.[5]\nThe Traveler's sibling eventually leads the Abyss Order after becoming separated from the Traveler and seeing the \"truth\" of the world.\nThe Abyss Order usually conscripts Hilichurls to do their work. Most were former citizens of Khaenri'ah who were originally from the lands of the gods and relocated there. When Khaenri'ah fell, they were cursed with the \"wilderness\" and transformed into hilichurls.[1]\nBecause many hilichurls are cursed citizens from the destroyed nation of Khaenri'ah, the Abyss Order and the Traveler's sibling hope to cleanse the curse from the hilichurls so that they may either \"return to the natural cycle of life and death as soon as possible\" or, according to Dainsleif, become the foundation for the to-be-rebuilt Khaenri'ah if they are successfully cleansed.[6]\nAround 500 years ago, the fall of the Eclipse Dynasty led to a cataclysm that destroyed Khaenri'ah.[7] Sometime after the fall of Khaenri'ah, Chlothar and his transformed son Caribert moved to Avidya Forest for the latter's medical treatment. He met the Traveler's Sibling, and together they discovered the \"Sinner\", a chained crystal hidden within the Unknown Sanctuary. The Sinner imbued Chlothar with Abyssal power, allowing him to restore Caribert's sentience. Chlothar concluded that the power of the Abyss was able to do what the Seven could not and reverse the Khaenri'ahn curse. Inspired, he began to worship the Sinner and eventually founded the Abyss Order, appointing the sibling as his \"Prince/Princess.\" The sibling, while disturbed by his ramblings, soon learned the truth of Teyvat and became disillusioned, joining the Abyss Order after finishing their travels.[1]\nThe sibling is revered by the Abyss Order, who address them as \"Prince/Princess\" of the Abyss.\nIn the beginning of the game, the Abyss Order takes advantage of Dvalin to incite him to destroy Mondstadt. However, Venti and the Traveler are able to purify the Abyssal poison in his veins and restore his sanity.[8]\nAfter, the Abyss Order attempted to execute their Loom of Fate operation. To this end, they planned to use the ancient technology within the \"Field Tillers\" from Khaenri'ah, searching through the many Ruin Guards littered throughout Teyvat hoping to find the eye of the very first one. They intended to use both the Defiled Statue underneath Mt. Aocang and the eye on Osial to create a mechanized god they could control. However, the Traveler and Dainsleif found the first Field Tiller's eye at Stormterror's Lair before the Abyss Order could, and Dainsleif opted to keep it with him rather than entrust it to another party.[4]\nA group led by Enjou would later arrive in Enkanomiya to look for the book Before Sun and Moon, which would serve as proof that Celestia came from beyond Teyvat. Due to an unrelated situation on Watatsumi Island, the Traveler would descend into Enkanomiya, resulting in the operation failing with a large amount of casualties. Later on, Enjou would negotiate with the Bathysmal Vishap to engulf Enkanomiya in darkness so they could rescue their kin inside the Dainichi Mikoshi. This appeared to serve no useful meaning, since Enjou had no real reason to help the vishaps.[9]\nThe Abyss Order became aware of an unusual pool of water in the Chasm that would subdue the effects of the curse placed upon them. The Traveler's sibling, determined to reverse the curse, authorized an experimental device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects — this was despite its low chance of success and the high chance of causing undue suffering to the hilichurls. The operation was foiled by both Dainsleif and the Traveler, the former having been accidentally been sent to the Chasm and the latter investigating unusual hilichurl activity.[10]\nSometime after the events of the Sumeru Archon Quests, the Abyss Order began to meddle with the Ley Lines around Avidya Forest for reasons unknown. Dainsleif manages to put a stop to it, though the Ley Line disruption allowed the Traveler to relive their sibling's time with Chlothar in the same location centuries ago.[1]\nRoughly 500 years ago in Sumeru, a descendant of Hadura, Klingsor, became enthralled by the powers of the Abyss and learned of some of the truths he had suspected were hidden from him by the Skeptics. He led a group of Abyss Order members and monsters to attack Vourukasha Oasis to obtain the Great Songs of Khvarena in order to break the seal over the Harvisptokhm, though they were ultimately pushed back by the Pari and the Skeptics. He was still persistent, and later convinced the current head of the Skeptics, Nasejuna, to help him break the seal. They convinced the Pari Sorush that she would need the songs and sacrifice herself to do so, but the plot was foiled by the Traveler, who had stumbled upon the Pari and agreed to help, while harboring suspicion towards Nasejuna due to his behavior while obtaining the songs and reinforcing the seal.[11]\nAfter the Divine Throne of Hydro was destroyed by Focalors, the Traveler's sibling noted that despite the flagrant disregard for the \"rules\", the Heavenly Principles did not react, concluding that they had a \"situation\" of their own up above. Continuing the Loom of Fate operation, Caribert's consciousness manages to fool Dainsleif into believing that he had given the eye of the Field Tiller, prompting him and the Traveler to check the ruins to see if he had done so. The Traveler's sibling, along with a Abyss Herald: Frost Fall, ambush the pair and begin tampering with the Ley Lines, prompting Dainsleif to send the Traveler away. The sibling then confronts Dainsleif and manages to injure him in the ensuing fight, while the Traveler discovers Caribert and enters his mind realm. Caribert explains the purpose and nature of the Loom of Fate before he expires, while the Traveler's sibling also runs into the realm and reunites with the Traveler, explaining their motives and reasonings to them before they are forced to leave when the space collapses. The sibling manages to recover the eye from Dainsleif (who had hidden it in his body), allowing the operation to continue as planned, with the sibling hoping that they could fully activate the Loom of Fate before the Heavenly Principles awakened.[5]\nEnjou would later travel to Natlan in order to study lore about the Turnfire and Mare Jivari, where he would negotiate a deal with Kinich to do his \"historical research\" in return for summoning a Beastly Rift for him. Kinich intended to use the rift in order to place a severely deteriorating Kongamato in it for both it and his tribe's safety. Secretly, Enjou struck a deal with Ajaw to claim his body, though this was actually a ploy Kinich and Ajaw had set up in order to lure Enjou to the Traveler, as Kinich was aware they sought information regarding the Abyss Order. While the lure worked, Kinich had not been aware that the two had known each other and Enjou left after a short conversation with them.[12]"
